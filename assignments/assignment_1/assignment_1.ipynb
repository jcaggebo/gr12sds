       "'On time, clean car, reasonable prices, very reliable service, great communication\\nThere products are great the visitor sign in sheet, has the confidential sign in, and I use the badges for visitors and substitute  teachers. Great products.\\nNo hassell no headache.....\\nI ordered a Gibbs Rules mug (2032996089) and I was disappointed that the rules are not readable even with magnification. The font is just blurry.\\nI am in agreement with the negative reviews. After I made a flight reservation a screen popped up offering  me a rental car for a good price. It was a very specific. It made an offer of a weekly rate at a specific dollar amount. It did not say “as low as”, or any of the other things you expect when they don’t intend to honor the rate. When I tried to reserve the car the link took me to a page with much higher prices. When I received my email confirmation the same offer popped up offering a rental car for a good price. Again, when I tried to click on the link it took me to a page with much higher prices. I wasted two hours on the phone speaking to customer support asking them to honor their offer. What does it say about a company where the support people are all named Al or Alice or Albert? They don’t even give you their real names but they do give you many illogical excuses for why they can’t honor their offers. This is clearly a dishonest and dishonorable company and I would not recommend them to anyone.\\nThe sales person went out of his way to help me find what I wanted.\\nVery happy with their product.\\nI ordered a customized mug for my sister for Christmas. The picture i selected turned out great on the mug. I am extremely happy with my purchase and my ordered arrived in about a week.\\nProduct arrived quickly and was of good quality.  Quick installation too!\\nI was very pleased with the results .\\nI still need to speak to my clients upon their return BUT I can say that from the moment that their flight departed from NYC Via Tours Croatia was on top of everything from making changes, to putting out any hiccups to making every little event become a reality for my honeymoon clients. Someone was always in touch with them. I will continue to refer Via Tours Croatia to my fellow travel counselors.\\nExcellent service\\nSupport by Chrono24 is very trustful and I\\'d like to buy again via Chrono24.\\nI bought a ticket. And one hour later I got  a mail I get my money back and I didn\\'t get the price of the flight. vert unrelaible - I bought tickets and hotel through this reservation that i cant get back. \\r\\nEven if you did have a technical problem, you should take some responsibility for that.\\nI have never used their service before.  I was very impressed with their prompt attention to my order.  I definitely will use this service in the future.\\nI am a regular customer of Advance America and find that the service is excellent and would recommend them for everyone\\'s needs.\\nYour personal thank you letter thanking us for our order was a nice touch.\\nI love the Taylor of Old Bond Street line of products.\\nThis is my second purchase with \"The Pearl Source\". Very happy! The pearls are beautiful and the service has been excellent. Great communication & also great that customs etc. is all taken care of so there are no surprise expenses if purchasing outside of the USA. \\nHighly recommended.\\nI LOVE stationery, and had planned to use a local paper company for our invitations.  Fast forward to a few months before the wedding . . . out of time and over-budget.  Our wedding planner recommended using Minted.  It was fast and the paper quality is impressive!  I\\'m really pleased.  Plus, they\\'ll address your envelopes for free.  BONUS!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only two things I\\'d caution about (but still with my full recommendation of Minted):  if you order envelope liners, you have to assemble them yourself.  Not so fun after the first 10!  And designs aren\\'t as customizable as presented . . . you get a little leeway, but not full control.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Minted!\\nI just love the service my father gets from the LifeStation! I feel secure at work now and know my father is well taken care of. We have had to use this a couple of times and the response times are just incredible! My dads care was so quick! He is very happy and secure at home now! Thank you so very much! Would recommend Lifestation to anyone.\\nI truely love Travelocity! It is quick and easy to book my travel needs with Travelocity. I also am able to get great prices.\\nExcellent service.  Will definitely use again\\nFriendly people that treated me and my time with respect. Funds were delivered quickly and the process was smooth. Would recommend and use again for sure.\\nI would order again if an occasions should arise.  Labels look great.\\nI love TopCashBack! It\\'s so easy to receive payment by just going through the website. I online shop anyway so this site is perfect. I\\'ve also come across new websites I hadn\\'t shopped on before with great sales. \\nOnly cons- It takes a bit for processing to receive the payment. Other than that, it\\'s great!\\nI’ve been very happy with National Debt Relief. They have really put my mind at ease working with my creditors. I like I can log in to my acct and review the progress. They really help with my stress. I highly recommend their service.\\nI was please with their website and its ease of use.\\nI recently had a medical question concerning my husband & used AskDoctorParker.com.  I was very satisfied with the response time.  The advice was very helpful.  I would recommend this site to others.  If need arises, I would not hesitate to use this site again.\\nQuick check out it waseasy\\nthe room was clean, its in the zone 1 of Paris,which is really good for city explorers. the people are kind and speak english. nice stay for some days in Paris. \\nits a little bit noisy by night, you can hear the people next to you speaking, but for few days its a nice location.\\nI\\'ve recently in the last 2 years decided to go all natural with meds and other things since my body was having harsh reactions to things. I discovered Native Remedies. I\\'ve made numerous purchases from them and will keep on purchasing things from them as I like the fact that the products don\\'t make me feel worse (like prescription meds). Their motto is all natural and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for 1 to save money and 2 to save your liver.\\nI like many people on One.com were forced to pay renewal fees for a domain even though I had asked to cancel my account and all they do in response to my emails is quote their terms and conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne would think when you ask to cancel and then you get an email reply from One.com saying that your webspace is cancelled the matter is settled. No, not at all One.com instead has a company called Intrum Justitia that send you threatening letters about how you did not pay and they have sent you so many reminders and SMS\\'s that now they will get a judgement against you. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo in the end after many emails back and forth between myself and their customer support trying to find an amicable middle ground I ended up paying the £20 and being done with it, because this is a company that does not stand by it\\'s word and will not see the customers side. They are here for the quick buck, so I hope the £20 serves you well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to say I was a faithful customer of 6 years with another one of my domains with One.com but since this experience I have now also cancelled my other domain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to say that I am deeply sorry for the other people on this site as I thought they were few and far between but as I have been reading the other reviews there are more and people that One.com treats this way and has absolutely no business ethos.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.s. Oh and wait, I bet you they will reply with some Terms and Conditions! ;)\\nservices I had from this site always met my expectation.\\nQuick and easy. Oksana on chat was very helpful.\\nUsing Viator.com is An excellent way to do excursions around the globe. They are reliable and accommodating even with rescheduling tours; I will always make use of Viator.com and can recommend them to all ages.\\nI sent two soups and crab cakes to my dad for Father’s Day. He loved it!!  Said the soups were outstanding and that the crab cakes were some of the best he’d ever had. \\n\\nIt was well worth it!  I have to admit, I appreciated the reasonable overnight shipping charge\\nExcellent customer service and very fast shipping even to Hawaii\\nGreat App! Surprising cheaper deals from time to time!\\nNeeded an emergency dentist and they couldn’t find me one. He never called me. So I don’t know if it’s 800 dentist or the dentist.\\nVery quick delivery, great product.\\nI received over 5 loan offers - each varied in interest - of course I applied to the lowest one and got the loan!  A++\\nNice easy checkout and selection!\\nTired of paying dealer prices for parts or driving all around town looking for parts???? Go to the geek to get what you want, when you want it. Easy. I\\'m done.\\nQuality service. Knowledgeable techs. Corrected a tire/wheel balance problem that 3 other tire shops could not.\\nThe whole experience was very easy and painless\\nWeddingWire has been the best tool in my wedding planning. The budget, guestlist and forums have been my favorite tools from the site. The mobile app could use some revamping again, and the website might need some tweaks (ie, links to timeline, hashtag generator, etc) but it\\'s been great none the less! Love you WeddingWire!\\nTown fair tire was not ready for the appointment as scheduled and did not call to let us know.  We wasted too much time, unnecessarily, waiting for the tires to be delivered before they could be installed.\\nbetter than a travel agent\\nhad a great experience!\\nMy trip 931738 was cancelled by the owner of the property 8 days prior to flying half way across the world because she “has family coming into town”. I’m wondering if this is an acceptable business practice for your site?\\nIt is costing me a lot of money and time 8 days before a huge trip. Please help me make this right.\\nI love it!!! Shows off my body just right! Makes me feel strong and independent\\nI usually can always find what I am looking for at Thrift Books.  They ship quick and deliver when they say they will.\\nKabbage cared about my needs not just about making money. They asked all the right questions and came to my aid quick\\nEverything went as expected, was kept in informed right up to delivery.\\nVery Good! The best one!\\nChanged prices while I was making the reservation. Which at first didn\\'t go through. When tried again it was $20 more. Felt it was dishonest !\\nGreat CS team. Thank you!\\nI ordered the book and a week later it was at my door in perfect condition! great service\\nGreat productproducts, fast shipping. Would gladly do business again\\nI had a great experience dealing with Flashbay. I went with the natural wood usb product and it fits my business perfectly. Fantastic quality product and the printing of our logo is top quality.\\nThis website is awesome! I can check all details I need about the car and more. There are all details you might need and there are way fuller than I expected to see.\\nI always receive excellent deals with Priceline. The site is easy to use. I check out many other sites and almost always come back to Priceline for the best value for money spent.\\nI love what you guys done, the jacket fits PERFECTLY. Only thing I didn’t like, is how long it took to arrive. But other then that, I love it. \\nThank you much.\\nGave as a gift to a dear friend who is battling cancer. was told that the blanket was beautiful but the message i wrote to them was not included with the order. This was disappointing.\\nCarousel\\'s check registers are very reasonably priced.  My order arrived very quickly.  I\\'m very satisfied.\\nWe\\'ve use Budget Dumpster for jobs in Laredo, TX & Austin, TX. The only complaint I have was for the Austin job. They don\\'t rent monthly its based on a set day limit for a pull & swap. Anything beyond that acquires additional fees. Being a construction company having dumpster for month before having to swap it is normal. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther than that the staff was very nice & extremely helpful.\\nThey promptly notified me about minor problems in my application and helped me fix them.  Courteous and helpful.\\nHigh quality and on timie.\\nThe shirts look great, got here on time and it was easy to work with you.  You even sent me a couple shirts overnight to make sure I would get them for a deadline I had to hit (and the rest got here on time anyway).  Great customer service!  I already recommended you to some other folks.\\nFound the exact case I was looking for, decent price, easy ordering, and arrived pretty quickly. Case was just as shown and described, I love it!\\nGot me to the  airport  on time!!! My car was safe no stress!!!  I would use global parking again !!!\\nI was charged $99.99 for an All Shine but upon returning saw that only a portion of the car was cleaned. The Keys were left in it and I presume whomever was in charge thought I might not notice that only a portion of the car was cleaned. After addressing with the Manager and the Representative from All Shine I was assured I would receive a refund  from All shine. That was August 17th and I have yet to receive a refund?\\nVery quick and simple\\nThe title says it all.\\n\\nI used the handyman feature first to get the front door lock changed. Paid over $135 to handy, and another $125 for the lock itself. The handyman was good, no complaints on that or the job he did.\\n\\nI had wanted to try the cleaning service since I received an email saying that I would get 50% off my first time cleaning. When I went to schedule the appointment through the app, I found that i couldn\\'t use the promo code, because I had already used handyman services less than a week ago. How that makes sense, I\\'m not sure.\\n\\nI then contacted the company, wasted my time speaking to various people, and no one could honor the 50% off. I will get my house cleaned elsewhere. \\n\\nNot a good customer service experience.\\nAccidentally ordered the wrong fridge.  Called them up and they took care of it.  It was great to be able to order, then pick up the next day, when most other places took a week.\\nI had an order get canceled but did NOT get an email telling me that it was canceled.  After I called, I understand why it was canceled and the lady I talked to was very nice, but it would be better if I got an email quicker telling me about it.\\nI paid in advance for a room and was told that a shuttle would be waiting at the airport. No shuttle, no room.\\nI was offered a room 20 miles away but as I\\'d gone to Cuba to visit my children who were staying nearby this did not work. Do not use this company !!!\\nGot my parts very fast 7 i am happy with them. Will use parts geek again then next time I need parts for my vehicle.\\nExcellent.  No problems having and handling my order. Even getting it quicker than I expected.\\nIf you bought cancellation insurance doesn’t mean you will get full refund. They charged me $300 per ticket sine my flight is still 100days away. I contacted the airline, they gave me different information bout canceling policy. I do feel this website is scam, even worse than cheapoair.  If the airline charge $300, so no point buying tickets thru the agent. Save your agent fee and extra $100, you will pay more than $400 instead of $300. I don’t suggest  getting tickets from vayama, cheapoair, and kayak. If you do so, make sure pay with American Express card, easier to dispute.\\nAdd more varities of frames in your outlets.\\nPurchased 2 keys from here, the first one was delivered 6 hours late and the second one was never delivered. Pretty ridiculous since they claim to have automatic delivery. \\nOn top of that, their \\'customer support\\' is awful and never reply to you aside from the automated emails.\\n\\nSave your money, don\\'t bother with this site.\\n\\nedit: Key finally delivered but still no answer from customer support...\\nI have used rental cars for some 15 years and have always found the service very satisfactory. Even if ammendments are required.\\nEasy purchase online and fast delivery\\nBetter than all the rest\\nMy family and I truly enjoyed the Fat Tire Bike Tour of Paris.  We were a family of 8 adults and 3 children.  We all got the bikes we wanted, including my 7-year old grandson.  For our two 5-year old grandchildren who didn\\'t know how to bike yet, a trailer was attached to one of the adult bikes and they too enjoyed the tour.  Our tour guide, Kirstie, was fantastic!  She had a lovely Scottish lilt and made the history of Paris come alive!  It felt like she was just relating a story that happened yesterday.  I learned so much more about  Paris, French history, they way Paris as a city was planned than I ever had during past trips.  And biking around made us feel like local Parisians.  Kirstie took good care in guiding us safely through the busy streets of Paris.  Everyone in my family thinks that the Bike tour was the best!\\nafter 10 years and many many order ......never problems and good quality\\nIt was fast and simple\\nthe parts seem to be as good as oem.\\nI order greeting card folders and candle bags from ClearBags - the price was reasonable and delivery was excellent\\r\\nthank you so for keeping me crafting\\nGreat service.\\nWebsite was easy to use and parts fit exact, for a very good price.\\nWebsite is not intuitive.  I don\\'t like having to receive a complimentary magazine subscription with my order.  Don\\'t force things on your customers, complimentary or not.\\nNeeded to change my flight within 30 minutes of accidental booking the incorrect date and they wanted to charge me a fee of 75$ for a 150$ flight. Not worth it. I got them to lower the fee a bit however they still charged me. Never booking with this site again. Only booking directly with the airline.\\nThank you I deal with NYDress all the time they are excellent\\nJeff, the technician that came to my house, was personable and well versed in the alarm system.\\n I have bad eyesight, and the touch screen is easy for me to find and operate.\\n I am more pleased than punch with this new system compared to the other company I had.\\nAs before on numerous occasions, my purchasing experience at VapeWorld was a positive experience.  VapeWorld is and has been my first stop for shopping on any vape needs.\\nI had a already good booking but checked out their only platform and found a huge upgrade for a symbolic price without any effects on the total insurance I already bought for the prior booking. Great help though telephone too!\\nRecommended.\\nI put in for a loan and just like that I was prove\\nGreat Experience!\\nI lost a dear pet a few years back and cafepress allowed me to capture my beloved guy with a daily reminder of his image.   I live in Otterbox country but I\\'ve got to say this tough case is a huge competitor.   Aside from that, CP did an amazing job from printing the image to shipping my custom case fast.  Class business with class products.\\nDiverse offering of quality olive oil with option of organic growers. Well packaged and timely delivery. Prefer selecting my own when I need to reorder over those companies that auto ship their choice available.\\nPerfect replacement, excellent price and reasonable shipping and delivery time. I\\'ll certainly use your company again and recommend you to my friends.\\nThe shipping could have been faster -- better.  The book edges were creased I guess from the packing and shipping.  Overall experience was just okay.\\nQuick to install and tech are very friendly.\\nI was very happy with the Hugh selection and quality. It was easy to order. It arrived on time. The Mug turned out to a great surprise because it turned out to be way better than I expected and I expected it to be very good. I would definitely order again from these people\\nEasy to use tools to load and print.....pricing is unbeatable....oh yeah, the quality of the final product is excellent!\\nGreat service. Up to minute status a big plus.\\nThe fabric is heavy enough to hang nicely and light enough to move eadily. The pattern and colors are just right. I absolutely recommend if you want to have a fun bathroom just go for it!\\nEverything has gone very smooth.\\nFirst time I\\'ve worked with them, and it was great. We had no issues in any step of the way.\\nI now have my phone, without a scratch, and much faster than I expected it to ever be.\\nEasy checkout & fast service\\nOrdering from Cafe Press was easy and the product was as advertised.\\nI bought a refurb Nikon from buydig. The buying process went mostly smoothly. There was a problem with the item, but buydig stepped up with a solution and advice.\\nI loved my experience through them! I will never go anywhere but this site to book my cheap flights!\\nThey do what they say they will do. Customer service experience has always been friendly as well.\\nI\\'ve made about 20 orders from the site. 3 had been lost, probably for brasilian post service mistakes.\\nFriendly clean helpful\\nFast, hassle-free, efficient application and approval process, plus swift, on-the-level, and above all humane attention, explanation, and follow-through. Quick and direct wiring of much-needed funds. Yes, the rates are very high. But as a simple, straightforward, temporary - and immediate - solution to a difficult situation, I found the entire experience to be an enormous relief.\\nGreat service! Great products! Great experience...every single time!\\nGettington has great products at great prices storewide. I\\'ve been a member since 2012 and have made plenty of purchases with everything coming on time. I have nothing but high praise for Gettington.\\nvery nice watch and honnest price\\nEasy to use website, super fast free shipping and I like the idea of buying my supplements from a company that is dedicated to this.  Using a generic website with multiple sellers to buy something medically oriented makes me nervous about counterfeit items.  I trust PureFormulas\\nEveryone...from drop off of the car to pick up, drivers, etc. Unbelievable customer service, helpful. If you have your paperwork ready and follow pick up instructions...you are golden!!\\nThe New York Pass was so convenient and easy to use.  We saved money and avoided some long line-ups which made our trip so much better.  We also took advantage of the Hop-On Hop-Off bus offer when we ordered our Passes and would definitely recommend it as well.  Paying the extra for shipping and getting the guide books early was a big help in planning our trip.\\r\\nI would recommend the New York Pass to anybody wanting to see all the sights!\\nNo Yahoos, or yandexes or whatever - they dont stand a chance!\\nI have purchased several watches from these guys and there has never been a hitch.Great product, great prices, Great service.\\r\\nGeoffrey\\r\\nNew Zealand\\none of the only places I know where you can buy old consoles, old games and old accessories!\\nI was recommended to this parking service and planned to use it on my next trip.  I told another friend who was traveling  about this service based on my other friend\\'s experience.  They used Global and raved about the service.  I went ahead and booked my reservation for my own trip coming up.\\r\\nEast, quick and simple.\\r\\nThank you Global Airport Parking!\\nHAPPY WITH MY EVERYTHING\\nAmanda was a pleasure to work with. She was very patient and friendly, and handled our quotation and artwork changes very professionally, and our order was processed quickly and accurately. Very pleased--would definitely work with USB Memory Direct again.\\nGreat thing even hard to find prts they have them at unbeatable prices and delivered in no time.\\nCan\\'t wait to order more books from Thrift!\\nWe got the brace much quicker then we anticipated. I will definitely order from them again. Highly recommend them.\\nEverything was perfect.  Easy order, good price, no hassles, delivery came when it was supposed to and was all good.  Recommend\\nOverall this is a great company, however I do not order from them as frequently because I like to send the vase with the flowers becuase I never want to assume that someone has a vase, and I really hate the vase option. But there is only one vase to choose from. :(\\nI would recommend this company\\nI used PartsGeek to order Headlight assy\\'s. The prices were extremely low. Parts were delivered in 4 days. The headlights fit perfectly and arrived with new lamps installed. I was very pleased with the price and delivery time. I will recommend them to anyone.\\nWould just like to  say  how  impressed  I  am  with  the  speed and ease it was to purchase and the ease oof using the  site once again  many thanks\\nI order two times, but then cancel the order.\\r\\nNever order the book from this site\\nIM LOVE THIS SITE!! BEST MARKET!\\nLoved it! It\\'s a great product.\\nShipping was crazy expensive. This needs to be corrected. I paid a 1/4 more in shipping costs. I was prepared to pick the item up at the store. This is very deceptive and frustrating. I would suggest you figure out another alternative. I could have drove to Chicago and picked it up myself and drove back for cheaper than what you charge. How about give people the option to pickup at the store for no charge. Dont plan on going back and still on the fence about cancelling my order. \\nPro: Sales person was nice and helped me get what I needed though.\\nOrder was accurate, and came very fast\\ncould not change the pick up time.\\nit was a great website for job seekers\\nThe service was awesome the sales  personnel Miguel was very helpful and efficient i am very please with is expertise and knowing his stuff he was very professional and courteous  I will do business there again\\nWill definitely purchase from GMP again.\\nJust the right price!!\\nI was so blown away with my first order from this company so I had to check their reviews.  I ordered essential oils & some containers.  The oils are amazing.  I read some other reviews about expiry dates so I checked my items & there doesn\\'t appear to be any on the things I ordered.  I found the prices amazing & I was not upset about paying $18 in shipping when it took me 10 minutes to unpack everything because they were so heavily wrapped with plastic bubble wrap for protection. I also thought that the hand written \\'thank you\\' card with a coupon code inside for my next order was a fantastic touch,  It also has the persons name who packed the package & the other persons name who double checked the order.  I am in Canada so not sure if this location has different business practices but I am thrilled with the company.\\nBoth phone cases I purchased look great and are stronger than I expected, not flimsy or cheap feeling. Very nice quality\\nVery  good costumer service and all above\\nI bought 5 pieces of clothing and I was very disappointed with the quality of material. I bought them on sale, so managed to score three dresses, one skirt and crop top for around $150, and overall the material was very thin, the stitching itself was cheap so loose threading was seen as soon as I got them out of packaging, and the long, backless maxi dress that I was especially excited for fitted perfectly around my rib age, but then there was too much material along the sides and it sagged out on the sides, rather than fitting to my body. Also, the skirt was much to big for a \"small\". They tempt you with slashed prices, but as there is a no returns policy for sale items, it really is a waste of money. Not sure if these a re sellable either, because I wouldn\\'t want to sell someone unwearable clothes, it would be unfair.\\nvery useful, fast responses!\\nI have been using DIY Awards for 3 years for all of our companies award needs.  The awards always look amazing.  They are so easy to work with and always make the process painless for me.  I am always happy with both the product and the experience and look forward to working with them again on our next award project.\\nI am very new with this company but I can honestly say they have been great this far.

The not-showing of the prices can be somewhat of a hassle, but otherwise shopping with NFM was a pleasant experience.\\nI bought these golf shoes as a Christmas present.

On top of that, I contacted the owner who did none of the things he promised to try to \\'make it right.\\'  Not only would I never use them again, but I would advise that YOU DO NOT use this moving service.  Save yourself the trouble and find a company that will treat your things with the same care that you do.\\nThey took very long to deliver my order and that too a bungled one! The health of my eyes is at stake here but they didn\\'t do a good job at this!\\nThe staff over at suppz did a great job ensuring that I got what I needed in a timely fashion.\\nStuart was polite and very helpful, answered all my questions.\\nHad a great experience ordering my new theater chairs with 4seating.com.  I\\'ve never ordered theater chairs before and had no idea the different choices and options which were out there.  I worked with Alex Osorio on my order.  Alex was awesome!   He never pressured me into buying anything.  However, he made sure that I was aware of the various options that were available in purchasing theater seats.  Alex took a significant amount of time in understanding our new space to ensure that we were purchasing the proper seats for our room.  He even steered me clear of certain chairs knowing they wouldn\\'t work for us even though those chairs were more expensive.    The process took a couple of weeks and Alex was always available to answer my questions and concerns at a moment\\'s notice.  I\\'ve never purchased anything this expensive online, but Alex made the experience worthwhile.   He also made sure I got the best price for my purchase.  After my order, I e-mailed Alex asking questions regarding setting up the space for the chairs.  Alex replied within 5 minutes with the various specifications.  Can\\'t say enough about 4seating and Alex.  I would highly recommend the Company and Alex to anyone.   Can\\'t wait to get my new seats.\\nI want running short of money to pay my utility bills. Fortunately, my search engine directed me to yellowloan.com, which provided me a simple solution for all of my financial problems. The returning conditions were so easy that I decided to apply for the loan. I just went through a simple application procedure, agreed the terms and conditions and waited for the money. Beyond my expectations, I received the money in few days and paid my bills. Yellowloan.com is the best solution to all of your financial problems.\\nI spoke with a representative and not really knowing what I wanted , or needed, she was very understanding and helpful in guiding me to the paddle I wanted.  She was very pleasant\\nExcellent products and fast delivery.  Great prices too!  The pens we ordered were very nice.

I ordered an item online that they delivered to an incorrect address and state. I had to call 7 separate times to find out after one month they no longer carry the item I ordered. Then I got the run around about my refund to my credit card and the gift card I also used.  Kohl’s must not be aware there are plenty of online websites that give superior service compared to them.  I will never torture myself again with any purchase from Kohl’s. Even after calling the corporate phone number twice I still never received a phone call back.\\nLike any moving company, you\\'ll have some glitches - but the guys that came out did a nice job.\\nBeautiful dress and on time\\nI have placed orders with them multiple times over the phone.

Very highly recommended!\\nNot only easy website, very user friendly, they also have AMAZING prices!!\\nNo customer service whatsoever, they are not regulated outside the US and don\\'t respond to any messages I have sent them, despite them sitting on £1000 of my money which has been \\'pending\\' for 21 days now. Fees are a scandal. This business should be ashamed of the way they conduct themselves, invest with this company at your peril. You have been warned !!.\\nI ordered compression stockings that were suppose to fit up to 24 inch calves and they wouldn\\'t fit over my ankles.  Did return them and they have acknowledged they were returned but stated my money wouldn\\'t be returned for 1-2 billing cycles--gee I wish I could pay my bills like that!!\\nThe chicken is very good.

Easy to use programs and fast delivery. Sometimes I find the price is a little expensive but receiving the 50% off coupons is a big help. Thank you mix book.\\nArrived in great timing after ordering, in excellent time shape and exactly what I was expecting\\nGreat service. Very easy to use! Gave it to my family for an early Christmas present.\\nMy mom loves your collage puzzles (less interested in landscapes and scenery).

Very easy process.\\nThese people take your money for 11 months then claim to not have an attorney in your area to represent you, then takes 45 BUSINESS DAYS to issue a refund on your money so in essence keeping and using your money to fund their business practices for free for 12 months!!

Again RUN DON\\'T WALK AWAY FROM THESE THIEVES!!!\\nTimely delivery, well packed, directions were adequate, and merchandise was high quality.\\nThis is the first time I\\'ve purchased a flight on JustFly and it was a fairly easy process.

Once I get down to half of my supply I am able to order online and know that I will receive my order before I run out. My only complaint is that I use Meow Mix and I did not see it when I went to order it on the web site. Maybe I missed it but I need it so if I can\\'t get it from PetBest I will have to discontinue ordering from them and look elsewhere so I hope I just missed it when I did my first order! We will see!\\ni just ordered and it was easy. i have not got my tv yet..\\nGet time experiencing Italy.  Farm home cooking to really get the feel of at home cooking.  Love the trip and all the guides. They gave us lots of historical information, and were very friendly.\\nThe order delivered was absolutely nothing like the one pictured on their site.  I ordered the Soothing Lavender bouquet along with a stuffed teddy bear and 3 balloons. All of the items were upgraded to a cost of $110.  When I spoke to the agent I was very specific about the color and bear and all was confirmed.  The next day I received a call to return their call. After holding 45 minutes I was told that some of the lavender flowers were not available.  I ok substitution on some of the flowers and reconfirmed the medium sized teddy and the lavender vase.  What was delivered was a substandard bouquet of mixed colored flowers with a polka dot ribbon and a stuffed pony fit for a five year of with only one ballon.   I contacted Avas and again held for over  45 minutes.  Their resolution was to give me a $20 credit!  My next step is to file a complaint with the better business bureau.\\nEvery aspect of trip,flight,rental car ,accommodation  was top notch.\\nNot a single glitch anywhere.\\nDownloading necessary documents also made for an easy overview.\\nPowerscourt was an awesome experience,and a wonderful.surprise.\\nI have no complaints whatsoever.

Well done! Fast and friendly\\nGreat service--helped me find what I needed and followed up after our phone call! Thank you!\\nMy only reservation is that Parts Geek is not reachable by phone.  Perhaps this doesn\\'t matter for most orders.\\nI was not happy that they wanted to charge us a setup fee as we have ordered the same product before.  Also, how did they print the sample they sent us.  If you offer an item for a specific price....make sure it is that price and not higher with a bunch of add-ons.  I am busy and don\\'t have time to play games.  We also ordered the assortment of colors.  We only received 2 colors.  We were told that it was because that was the way they were randomly packaged.....well, we received one box of red and one box of black.  There is nothing random about it.  They did send us 20 more of a different color at no cost, but I would rather not waste time calling them.\\nHaving a lot of issues with the phone app.  Many times can not connect through the app and system doesnt work as promised.\\nThis place is so clean.

I have been with them for a very long time and can always count on sending a message that is unique and, depending of the occasion find a card that perfectly salutes the occasion. I also find it a fun thing to do and an excellent way to use your creative energies! I can honestly say there has never been an occasion when I was crunched for time that Smilebox didn\\'t come through with just the perfect solution and I was saved the embarrassment of not having an appropriate, thoughtful card to send to a friend, colleague or family member. Kudos Smilebox!\\nID Wholesaler has gone out of their way to help us. First Class all the way!\\nThe best, fast shipping.

I\\'ve had issues w my order and have received speedy replies and solutions. A lot of variety in well categorized options. Good user experience design.\\nGood service. Great car. Easy collection and drop off.  \\r\\nThe only critisism is that you have extra payments on collection...full tank of petrol up front 72euros and extra insurance (for windscreen and wheel cover) appaently not covered on the policy? 42 euros a one off payment, other wise you have to leave a huge 400 euro deposit, this came to 114 euros, £93. They have a pay for a full tank of petrol bring the car back empty policy which if you dont plan to do a lot of driving then you have paid out for petrol you do not use. I have used other companies where you collect the car full and return the car full, that way you only pay for the petrol you use, which i feel is a fairer way of doing it?\\nPassports showed up exactly when the said they would. Was a little leary at first but communication was great.\\nReceived product in a timely manner and thanks.\\nI would like to thank the staff of this facility, they were very friendly and answered all of my questions.  My move in and move out were a very good experience and I would recommend this company to anyone in need of a storage facility.\\nMy experience was amazing with CardKangaroo. The process was easy, and after paying, I got a phone call confirmation within minutes, and my gift card about 5 minutes after. Overall, from payment to receiving the card, everything was super smooth and quick. In total, the card took about 15 minutes after payment to arrive. I had tried Cardpool right before I tried this site, and not only did they take 24 hours to \"process\" everything, they sent me an email saying their risk assesment team wouldn\\'t process my payment, so that was a huge waste of time. Comapred to that, CardKangaroo was amazing.\\nThis was my first time using the service. They are very professional and efficient. There was someone there to pick us up by the time we walked to the meeting spot. My car was ready and warmed up when we got back to the lot. They are worth a try.\\nGreat customer service!  Matt helped me get the cards I needed, and shipping time was extremely fast.\\nEverything came out fine, they gave me exactly what I requested. The only thing I did not like was the thickness of the paper for application. As my background was black office plaques, it was difficult to see through it for positioning. Otherwise I was totally satisfied.\\nAT&T is an amazing company that has helped me reach my business goals, that would not be possible otherwise. Don\\'t listen to these other people who are just crazy about T-Mobile, Verizon (etc). Go with a network to you can trust. \"AT&T Rethink Possible\"\\nI am sad to say that I only realized that this amazing resource exists. The service was fast, professional and educational.

Economical with fuel consumption.\\nHello all. Using rentalcars for 5+ years without any concerns. And actually today was pushed to rate this site for 1 star only due to absolute unprofessionalism from the staff of this company. \\nLong story short - I have booked E class in Italy from GreenMotion through RentalCars. Have printed confirmation of E class booking. Have email voucher with confirmed status. After several weeks on the web site it was silently changed to C class. I noticed this occasionally when was trying to book another car for my friend. I have a mail thread with rentalcars customer support with official apologies and confirmation of internal error caused this incident. Plus I have the same mail confirmation from customer support that E class will be booked for me from another vendor. As a result today I received a notice that no one is responsible and nothing will be changed. And if I have any concerns I could cancel my booking (go far far away) or open customer support case AFTER the booking. So now I have no time to do anything by myself (no cars are available)\\nVery upset, guys. Reputation of this wonderful service is ruined.\\nGood Service and good people\\neven if you order a month in advance they screw up the delivery and send dead flowers.\\nIt\\'s so simple to use and you get great prices - it\\'s the simplest and best way to shop for flights.\\nI found tops I can wear\\nMadina Zaid branch abudhabi\\nManager prasna \\nSir iam very appricate to all of ur crew member ND they so nice ND very humble as well as u and specially thank u prasna sir when I visited their in ur branch u solved my problem very humbly with very instantly and u r doing very fast transaction thanks to all of u\\nNothing to say.

My books were received in a timely manner and just as described!  \\n\\nThank you!  I will definitely use this site again!\\nGood company and overall a fast and painless experience.

That made me feel a little nervous but my bag arrived on time and with no problems. Thanks!\\nQuality products,prompt shipping and excellent pricing\\nYou guys have a great coverage of East African Region . But u only need to spread more in the Rural Areas. You are only centred in Urban Centres. I am Ugandan And I only access your services only in Kampala.\\nRepresentative was helpful. She knew exactly what I needed and the price was great.\\ninstant delivery. all works fine\\nA week after I placed my first order with doggiefood, I called the company to follow-up on its status because it still was listed as \"processing.\" I was told they were out of the items I ordered.  But, they just got one the items in and would ship it the next day with an arrival day in four business days. I was told the other item should be in stock in a couple of days. Eight business days later I emailed the company to cancel my order because I had not received either product. Their reply was that the 1st product had shipped and would be here that Thursday. However, the other item was on back order and they would gladly refund me for it. Four hours later I received this email \"I had just went to have the orijen refunded and then was informed that they did in fact have the orijen sent out to you. I am very sorry for the confusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe eventual did receive the two items we purchased. However, the kibble was wrong. We ordered a 5lb. bag, but received 7 12oz small bags instead - not very convenient, but we were happy to have finally received our order. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral days later, I received a phone call from the company stating, \"as YOU know YOU received a double shipment of your order. We can send FedEx out to pick it up or we can charge your card if you want to keep it.\"  We did not receive a double order; and did not even receive our original order correctly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many dog food companies out there. If you are looking for good customer service I would not choose doggiefood.\\nWe have always had top-notch service with TherapyNotes, without a doubt.\\nIts in their name: Thrift Books. I was looking for the most affordable offer online and I\\'m so glad I found Thrift Books. Not only do they offer a wide range of book selections that I\\'m looking for, its also the cheapest with the best shipping & handling deal I\\'ve found. Upon ordering two books, they ask if it was ok to upgrade one book that was in \"acceptable condition\" to \"good condition\" at no extra charge just because it was most eco-friendly and efficient. Received my books in time and in good condition. Companies that take the extra step to be considerate and environmentally-aware show me they have ethics and values past just making a dollar. They have my trust and is my go-to when checking for books to purchase online.\\nThe loan process was fast and easy, and the customer service was excellent! I would highly recommend this company to everyone who needs a little help with funds.\\nI am a Costco and Sams Club shopper for my pool supplies.  After a little searching decided to try Doheny\\'s.

Great homes, lovely families and their animals are always so lovely too.  I have recommended the company to friends who are now using you also and very pleased too.\\nIt was easy to reserve parking. The shuttle left timely for the airport and no issues with where we parked. The only issue was that we were not given clear instructions on where to wait for the pick up shuttle at the airport until we had already waited 20 minutes and I called the hotel. Now I know where the hotel shuttles pick up I would probably use this service again. It did save us money over parking at the airport.\\nThe book was in great condition and was delivered on time unlike others. I\\'m sure to begin my searches for other books here.\\nSometimes a little expensive but love choice of patterns.  Love new glove but the thumbs are too long can this be corrected\\nI have several warranties and made a few claims.

I continue to be amazed each time I see a new transformation. Not only can you choose to get your hair back gradually (so no one will notice), but Hair Club\\'s privacy policies also make your experience completely confidential. I would 100% without a doubt recommend Hair Club services to anyone unhappy with their hair loss, including my own friends and family!\\nI have been ordering Lang products for years.  I used to live close to a store that carried the calendars but I moved so now I order online.  I have never had a problem with any of the products and they are A1.  The calendars are perfection and pictures worth saving once the year has passed.  I would recommend Lang to everyone.\\nI use Priceline for almost every hotel room I book.

I will also take advantage of their $20 rebate. Thanks Guys!\\nLove the prices and super fast shipping! Highly recommended!\\nI was perfect\\nOldies service was excellent.

This last time I had a few issues. One place I had put a down payment on cancelled because they sold their condo.  They should not have had it up for rental if it was on the market. Another owner had not marked off dates that were technically taken, again this caused me issues. Other than that, it is a great way to plan a vacation!\\nMy experience with thrift books has been good. The only thing that can be improved on is the shipping of items. They offer free shipping on $10 or more orders and that\\'s great because the prices of the items are very reasonable.  I think if the items are shipped and received with a turn around time of two days it would be even greater. But I will continue to return. I\\'ve mentioned this website to other friends. \\n\\nHonest Maddy\\nGreat product, but even better customer service\\nGreat service. Honest people.

The living room set that I seen and was interested in was conveniently on sale.  The sales rep was very friendly and did not waste my time  trying to sell me something and I wasn\\'t interested in.

Thank you so much to the whole Gardner White Payment I truly appreciate it and love my new living room set!\\nThe website and ordering process was user friendly, however when I received the product I was very disappointed.

They were very polite, and the storage unit comes with nice benefits such as a free moving truck for move-in and one free heavy-duty shelf. I\\'ve had other units in the past, but never one that came with such nice benefits. I even get a discount for being a Veteran. I appreciate that.\\nIm a long standing loyal Swagbucks user!

The assistant provided me with all the documents and the car key in minutes. The entire process was very fast and efficient. Hovewer , even though I was told the car had no damages, I went and checked personally and I needed to highlight few issues but still the assistant was prompt to accept them all and record them on the documents provided. Overall very happy about the service provided, the car and the value for money. Highly recommended.\\nFully satisfied with product\\nDHL Sucks!!!! the worst courier service ever. They lied about not delivering my package at the workplace when in fact we stayed up late at work just to wait for that package and yet they declared that \"Consignee Premises Closed\". The Gate was open, our office was open and we didn\\'t even see their truck pass by or pulled over our vicinity for them to conclude that it was close. Their customer service are very inefficient in handling this complaints too and couldn\\'t even resolve the problem. All they can do is apologize without even taking action to resolve the case.

I have already recommended the sight to a number of my friends and business associates\\nEasy to order, ships fast, best price!\\nI\\'ve just house sat for the first time through the Trusted Housesitters website and I think it is a great concept! Pet owners know that someone will take good care of their house and pet, and don\\'t have to send their pets off to a shelter during their holiday. And the pet sitter have the great company of a furry friend, can live in a well equiped house or apartment and explore new places as a local and not a tourist. Perfect, I can recommend it to anyone!\\nExcellent service, shipping, and selection.\\nReceived a great product in a timely manner. Will order again if I need more parts. Great prices also.\\nPart fit great arrived quickly will order from this company again!\\nIGNORE  THIS REVIEW AT YOUR PERIL\\nif I could give zero stars it would still be too good for this gang of charlatans\\nI booked a trip for my daughter using this company as booking direct with the carrier was not an option.  I booked for my daughter and three friends.  The trip involved three flights there and three back.  On the day they were due to fly out I received boarding passes for everyone except my daughter (who happened to be lead passenger) I called and was put on hold for about 30 minutes.  I was then told that I would receive the boarding pass in 4-6 hours and that the matter had been escalated.  Next morning I called at 6.00am and again told I had a waiting time of 15 minutes, 10 minutes later I had a waiting time of, you guessed it, 15 minutes.  At approximately 7.00pm I got through to a very nice lady who sympathised with me and turned out no escalation had occurred the day before.  I received the boarding pass within two hours.  This also happened again a week later when my daughter was returning home.  Same problems getting through.  I contacted them via Facebook and even through LinkedIn (I got no response from Linkedin)  \\nI was fortunate that I was able to take time away from my job to deal with this.  I was also lucky that my daughter wasn\\'t at the airport at these times so we had some time.  I don\\'t know what people who find themselves in this position at the airport do.  Also to note that when I looked for the number on the website the second time, I could not find a telephone number - I got this on Facebook.  This is when I came across some absolute horror stories of people being abandoned and having to spend a lot of money to get home with no help from this company.  I read one good review after reading over 150 - yes I made the time to do this as I was so angry that a company can perform in this manner.  So I am going to tell as many people as possible about this, through social networking and also by contacting the CEO via LinkedIn \\nI have already spread the word to a few people who were just about to book with this sham of a company\\nI reacted poorly to this product and asked for a refund. The process was more difficult than it should have been. Not sure why they require return of the product (its food and can\\'t be resold) at customer expense when they say you have to be 100% satisfied.\\nThe items ordered were better than expected. Hassle free. I will do business with this company again.\\nGreat Bed. Great service. Quick delivery.\\nSite had what I wanted and shipped quickly.\\nThe Bibles I ordered arrived on time and were actually in great condition even though description indicated acceptable condition. I\\'m very satisfied with my order and will continue to purchase books in the future.\\nPurchased 4 cotton blend shirts and washed them in cold water the 1st time and they shrunk 2 sizes.  The shirts are now un-wearable!  I have asked for a resolution and they did nothing to help me.  I will never recommend this company!\\nBundle Stars, along with another couple of sites has become my go to place for shopping for games for PC. Always more variety and deeper discounts than steams weekly specials. Check them out!\\nI think this is a very cool site. A lot of the time I am thinking about getting a credit card and I don\\'t know which one to apply for. This site has so many and it helps to read the reviews that other people have written to find out which card I should apply for. I will definitely be using this website in the future. I also like that you can also purchase prepaid debit cards as well as gift cards if you don\\'t want to apply for a credit card. I will also be using that feature as well.\\nThe one thing that really impressed me was the ease of contacting customer support and the quickness they reply. That in itself tells me this company wants the customer to be happy with their purchases and if not they will fix it. I have no doubts that I will buy from them again.\\nI first started doing this to make a few dollars and keep busy since I just retired, however; since I\\'ve started I realize just how important that this is! If you just fly though it you will not take anything away from it, but if you read it all you will get it just like I have. Keep them coming and please stay very interesting.\\nYes, Its best and quick. As usual.\\nlove this place shippings expensive.. but it equals out in the long run to be cheaper then other places. love it!!!\\nLove the customer service! Fast shipping!\\nWindows 10 Pro key was not accepted for activation.   Microsoft\\'s verification site doesn\\'t even recognize it as a valid key.  After 20+ years in IT, I\\'m not going to fight the nonsense anymore with keys that don\\'t work.  I just gave up and used my original Windows 7 install on a new build and explained the situation to MS and got the activation to Windows 10.   Didn\\'t need to buy this at all.\\nThe cutout letters we chose, were exactly what we wanted. We are very pleased with the finished product. We wanted spooky, we got spooky! They came, when they said they would and they were packaged beautiful. All in all, we would recommend craft cuts to others.\\nIn the few months I have been dealing with the Easy Comforts people I have had no problem with any of the products so I have no real reason to deal with a problem with them on that front.  I do however have a real problem when it comes to their website and getting help with that.  Ordering is no problem but trying to figure out how to make a payment online is a real problem and no one has helped me with that yet.\\nCarid did excellent job in delivering the product on time, as expected, great quality, and great price! I did not have to contact the customer service (as there were no issue) and satisfactory), so cannot comment on how their customer service performs. I would recommend buyers to check out their products as they seem to offer competitive prices.\\nWhat ever I need or want, can find at the Mart, and ordering on line to drive thru pick up is a timesaver\\nBoth Robin and Tris were very polite and very helpful.

This is my second order.\\nQuick and easy to work with and very prompt service.\\nSuper Easy to book\\nThis was my first time taking a chance and ordering a car part online. I ordered a radiator for my Toyota truck and all was smooth. Although I couldn\\'t get the pay-pal link to work on my phone, I paid direct and the radiator came 4 days later. Very reasonably priced! Midas had quoted me $645 for this job. I bought it here for $120 and my husband installed it. Saved a ton of money!!

Mine were for a gift to give to our wedding party for our wedding coming up in May. We wanted to ask them in a fun, unique way so we created wine labels for the girls and whiskey labels for the guys with a catchy saying asking them to be our bridesmaid or groomsman. The team was VERY helpful if I ever sent any emails with questions they responded FAST! They were made and ship extremely fast as well. I received them before I could believe it! Love this company!\\nI scheduled to be picked up at 0500, but at 0503 I received a text that the driver would be arriving at 0514.

No advance warning enabling me to get in touch to ask for a redelivery. Hopeless, useless.  If you can find out what delivery company your prospective order uses, I would suggest cancelling if they use Yodel!\\nYou\\'ve gotta go on PL.

See below.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo jerk - I ordered one pack of the buffalo jerk to try it out before buying a whole box and this is one the best jerkies I\\'ve had. It\\'s very tender, very tasty and not too sweet. It does have a slight hint of sweetness but not where it takes away from the jerk flavor. I loved it so much I ordered a box. I had been looking for a nice healthy snack & excited I found this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHemp Force Protein Bar - Awesome protein bar! The bar has a really nice texture, very satisfying and I just love the healthy ingredients. It\\'s nice to have tasty healthy option. I don\\'t mind paying a high price for an outstanding product. All the ones I\\'ve had before by other companies have been loaded with sugar. \\r\\n\\r\\nT + Total Strength - I got this product a few weeks ago & am really loving the results. I feel like I can push myself harder than before. I work two job & sometimes feel worn out to workout. I\\'ve used this as a pick me up to get me going. I\\'ve tried other products alike & most times it\\'s loaded with sugar and or made from synthetic ingredients where I breakout. I was initially hesitate about ordering until I found out about their return policy. It gave me the courage to purchase as I\\'ve wasted money on products before because of the break outs & couldn\\'t return them. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnnit 180 -The first day I tried this product I had half of a pack. I felt a slight bit of alertness, focus, and just a general good vibe. The second time, I increased my dose to 3/4 of the pack & those feelings increased. I was glad I didn\\'t have any negative side effects since I\\'ve been so sensitive with other products in past. I would definitely order more. \\r\\n\\r\\nI found out about Onnit through Ameer Rosic\\'s podcast & really glad I found out them. I had slight shipping issue & it was taken care quickly. Overall I\\'ve had a great experience with their products and customer service. Also, I bought the Pull-up bar and Battle Rope. I haven\\'t used it yet & excited to try it out this weekend!\\nThis was a good company to sell my books to since I received the payment onto my paypal account as soon as the books were received. Would definitely recommend as a well trusted and genuine company.\\nI ordered the checks I wanted at a fair price and they showed up at my door within a very reasonable time frame.

The booking was confirmed and ticketed within a day. This was an Alitalia reservation with the first two legs (LIT- ATL, ATL-FCO) operated by Delta so I logged on to Delta and chose our seats.  Our flight is scheduled for tomorrow, but upon attempting to print boarding passes today I have discovered that the ATL- FCO flight was rescheduled by Delta through JFK.  No problem except that the change was never confirmed by FareDepot so now we aren\\'t confirmed on tomorrow\\'s flight.  FareDepot has been completely unhelpful.  Calls to both Alitalia and Delta refer me back to our travel agent.  FareDepot tells me I can travel three days later or get a refund.  Those are my choices.  No refund for hotel or rental car reservations.  I\\'ve checked the Delta web site, and there are flights still available to Rome tomorrow.  And on the Alitalia web site, my Rome to Pisa flight is still there under my record locator and available for check-in.  It appears that FareDepot completely dropped the ball on this and has no intention of making it right.\\nI was happy with my order and will use Overnight Prints again when I need more business cards.\\nI believe I purchased a Prada purse from you I like the process that you go through as far as the product authenticated process and your purse was here thank you\\nI stumbled upon them in a Google search. I had a question about a particular bag. Called them, and my question was quickly answered by a very nice human (didn\\'t have to jump through hoops first via robot). Their inventory is phenomenal. I even received a thank you email after my order, and an explanation that my bags would be shipping get from multiple locations. Shipping was incredibly fast!! Excellent experience all the way around. I found my new source for my bags!\\nMy mother woke up in tears to find out that Agoda had cancelled our hotel stay and taken over £500 out of her account.

I would recommend this company to anyone who needs a part for there vehicle.\\nGREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE\\nElizabeth was extremely helpful and I am super pleased with the outcome.\\nMy business website was down and since I take orders through my site I can\\'t afford to have it down for long.

Fast turnaround.\\nTelephone inquiries were answered in the most informed and courteous way\\r\\n\\r\\nMy plants arrived in beautiful, healthy condition and in a timely manner.\\nI have been in the program for two years now and have way thru.  Freedom has been great and look forward to being debt free.\\nThe staff was also five star!!  This is a wonderful destination for those who value not only the latest in tech i.e. window coverings, studios facing north, real desert plants maintained outside each and every residence,  floor plans that bring the outside in, not to mention, once again, five star amenities in bath, kitchen and laundry.  The ease of passing your trash from your floor location, to full mail service, to secure covered garage space, to extra storage available is so well thought out by developer.  Now I did not even get into topside pool plus amenities, nor fitness to any degree, whether it be your own personal trainer or yoga inside or outside on the grass.  Now the only thing left is food.  You can walk to a grand food lovers dream of everything from Mastros Ocean Club  to N.Italiano to Sheck Shack hot dogs r us, to the very special atmosphere extraordinaire Eddie Vs.  How could you not love this most beautiful place on earth.  My gift is an easy smile, and I am smiling all day long.\\nThey pick a winner so far very professional and sit down and explain in detail what need done and what is a priority and so far direct on with my cost and what my insurance pay Thank you 1800 dentist I stayed away from dentist too long\\nCottage was good, beds were very comfy but the best part is the lake with all the toys that are provided.  We had visitors,ducks,every day. Kids loved it and so did our dog who also used the paddleboards.  Fire pit was great..... all in all the cottage was a 4 star but be aware only one bathroom.\\nItem was in stock and shipped the next day. The lens was carefully packaged, arriving in perfect condition.\\nEvery item I purchased has great prices and quality.\\nThe reason for 5 stars is the quality of their research, and dedication of their physicians and staff. \\n I had been told the reality of my situation,from the beginning,  that for me at 69yrs old, runner, I would have 30% chance of Regenexx  to work for my RIght hip. I try to practice as much hope as possible and went for the 30...  I did end up getting a right hip rreplacement,  the 6 month evaluation, showed the hip worsening.  I also used Regenexx clinic for my back problems and it helped 100%...and my right ankle..which helped 90%.\\n  I can\\'t say enough about their honesty and dedication, and am truly grateful, I went there first before i had the replacement or else I wouldn\\'t be as peaceful about my situation which I did NOT want to do!!!\\nFirst, I was treated professionally while ordering. Another highlight for me, and why I will be a return customer, is because the customer service representative searched for and redeemed a coupon code for my purchase. My contacts also arrived earlier than expected. The prescription contacts received were what I ordered and I am a happy customer!\\nI have ordered from American Frame at least five times. The product is quality, ship time quick and selection amazing!\\r\\nAnytime I have had questions they are happy respond right away, making sure I am happy with the answer! Will be ordering again in the future !\\nLove love love!\\nI ordered 2oz honey bears for my daughters baby shower. There was severe weather in North Carolina where they were being shipped from so I called to check on the status of my order and they were very friendly and informative. They were shipped as soon as the weather permitted and I received them within a few days. They are adorable. My daughter and I absolutely love them and can\\'t wait to give them out.\\nOverall experience with Personal Comfort has been great! Customer service is awesome!  We love our new bed.  The only issue we had was with delivery and set up.  The delivery guys did not set up the bed correctly and argued about removing the old mattress when we paid to have the old one removed.  We contacted customer service and the issue was resolved immediately.  Other than that, we are very pleased with our purchase!  I would definitely recommend this company to others.\\nGood quality product delivered on time, delivery time was longer than expected and missed a Birthday by a few days.\\nthe beds are fluffy and comfortable the shower is a spa experience and the breakfast is outstandin\\nGood option!!!\\nEverything worked faultlessly, within the limitations that I had chosen. Because there were 4 adults & 1 infant my criteria were an estate car, at the best price from a company with an on-airport office, this limited my choice of deals. I had to pay for a full tank of fuel, but I used nearly all of it. I also heard that many companies were now finding minor faults on return and charging inflated repair prices, so I paid the 6E a day full insurance - expensive, but meant no-worries. I was directed to INTERRENT (which is part of Europcar). They were quick, but did not have the model of the estate that I had booked available, so without any fuss or extra-charge gave us a big diesel VW, which was a really good car. Return was also very quick. We felt sorry for Goldcar customers who had a huge queue to wade through.\\nSuggested by my nutritionist\\nThe school is one of the best things that could have happened to the City of Baker. I am glad they took on the role of coming into a community where education has decreased to give these community and young generation some hope....\\nI have been with Goldline for a few years and have had a good experience with them.\\nTed Otero\\nIt is absolutely ridiculous to expect me to rate Rentalcars.com a day after I have placed an order for a car that I will not pick up for over 2 weeks.  The only time I will know whether this is a good company to go with is once the contract has been fulfilled.  Try asking again a couple of days AFTER I have returned the car.\\nEasy app and process to find a perfect get-away property!\\nYou want my honest opinion but your staff are not.   I’m done beating a dead horse.  All I can do is tell myself lesson learned and never again.  So sad that to be my age and be so disrespected by your staff.

My 4 dogs and 4 cats enjoy your products everyday.\\nOutstanding\\nI order a Rim for my ford car, It got here in a about a week and thats because I put in the order on a Friday. The rim was brand new and in great condition, not to mention I got the rim at a great price!!! The website is also trustworthy, I would definitely recommend this website to anyone looking for a great deal. The only thing I recommend for them to do is pack the item better. My rim came in a huge box with no padded on it, but it was still in good condition.\\nLove the convenience of sending money to loved ones,  in an instant.\\nUsed them for many years and always had a great trip.\\nThey have a great selection of used books.\\nGreat price, good service, prompt delivery. I had a good experience using this company.\\nMy mom is in the hospital and I can always count on Remitly to send money to pay for her hospital bills. So easy and trusted company. Moneygram and western union sucks. They don\\'t want to accept my online transfer eventhough my mom is fighting for her life. Solid Remitly customer.\\nGot the pens for my coworkers they love it i love it awesome price\\nWonderful people to work with and quality products. I would recommend them to anyone needing cabinet or furniture hardware.\\nDesigning and ordering shirts from Rush Order Tees is unlike any other.  The graphic and font choices are the largest I\\'ve seen yet.  Don\\'t have a design in mind, it\\'s ok.  Just look over a few graphics and something will jump out at you.  Usually I have to upload a design, but not on this site.  Try them, you\\'ll love them!!!  Don\\'t go anywhere else.\\nI was thrilled to find an online store with free shipping that had NOW organic hot chocolate.

We needed to research a little more to find out what to expect... Anyway, needed to upgrade and are in the process of sending back for this.  The site has been extremely helpful and feel safe dealing with these people.  Something which is important when you are purchasing online.  Looking forward to getting our updated ring!\\nAll I have to say is... I was not happy about putting my house hold goods in any storage rental for personal reason\\'s not that Public Storage Rental is a bad place, just because of my personal life reasons.\\r\\nAll I\\'m going to say is, DO NOT EVER GET RID OF LAUREN!!! Give that girl a raise and take care of her, more businesses need more of her, she was excellent and made me laugh, I almost offered her a job working in property management that\\'s how good she was, she is smart knows her job and has excellent customer service, even being left alone on a very busy Saturday, she\\'s wonderful and If I could give her a job, I AM!!!\\nOutrageous! Customers are asked to take mug shots of themselves holding their ID and driver\\'s licence as a way of verifying their identity. Totally dispecable beyond imagination.\\nIt has been a pleasant surprise to be able to attend seminars that I am able to learn and apply to my professional career. The instructors have been approachable and will to answer questions or expand on a specific topic I needed quidance to achieve the best outcome.\\nThanks\\nYumi has been amazing every time she\\'s helped me!\\nMiles Kimball is the only source for this wonderful product.

Old fashioned confusing website, mobile check in unavailable without the app and not ready for the UK market\\nVery impressed when I received my shipment only two days after placing the order.

Excellent customer service.\\nI have been a member of rentalcars for quite a few number of years.  They have always provided good service, and provided me with decent prices (because, you pay what you get for with car rentals).  Overall, a pleasant experience and one that I would recommend to anyone.\\nWould definitely order from Bookbyte again.

A true godsend!!\\nTotally Wicked is a great place for all your \\nE-Cog needs.\\nLife fine has been quick to respond whenever the button has been tested. Thankfully, Mom has never had to use it for an emergency. She likes the wrist band as she is not as likely to set it off accidentally. Did not like the fall prevention as it was too cumbersome to wear on the neck, as is the necklace  life fone button.\\nGreat products, wonderful customer service and quick delivery.\\nBought contacts for the 4th time with no problems. But tried to use a code I had for free glasses and after wasting an hour the code never worked.\\nI wouldnt ever order from this company again. My girlfriend had ordered me a controller for christmas, it had just showed up on her doorstep 2 days ago. Thats over a month from when she ordered it. When we called to figure out what happened they said that it was \"just sitting on a shelf and that it would be shipped within a few days\" thats when we recieved it 2 1/2 weeks later. So we got it and i took it out of the box and was imediatly floored. They screwed up what she ordered the text that she got on the controller was in the wrong color and in the wrong font wich makes the controller as a whole ruined. And the so called \"mods\" that it comes with dont work on battlefield or call of duty which are both advertised on the site. And to top it off there were no instructions on how to use the mods or even find out which ones your using. I am completly disgusted by this company for selling peices of trash for so much money my gf ended up paying around $200 for something that was late, to overpriced and not even what we ordered. I will be writing a bad review everywhere i can on the internet unless this company rights their wrongs.\\nRoyal jelly from new supplier touted as better than the previous one, but now in #1 plastic jar (toxicity..?) with unnecessarily fancy lid. Keep it simple and as healthy as possible. I\\'ll go back to the previous product (in a glass jar) from another supplier.\\nI ordered bracelets with text. I received a proof in a format I couldn\\'t open and they sent me a PDF right away. Once I approved that, the bracelets were manufactured and shipped right away. I ordered 75 and received over 80 bracelets. i would order from this company again. I have also referred others to them for bracelets as well. Lots of choices.\\nService and quality is awful!! This company is scam ran by crooks\\nAt first I was quite happy to discover PartsGeek on-line to supply parts for my total re-build of a 1993 Eurovan.  Their web site was easy to use and to find the parts I needed so I ordered a large number of parts.  Unfortunately, the first time I had a question about a certain part I was only able to contact this group on-line and even though I tried several times my question was never directly answered.  Next, one of the parts I received - one of two tie rod ends - did not fit because the inner threads had not been cut correctly.  It was obviously a manufacturer\\'s problem but again, I could only contact PartsGeek via the web and was not able to talk with someone directly about the problem.  Even the phone number given on the web site resulted in a recorded message telling me to  contact them through the web.  I applied for a \"return item\" number and wrote an explanation of the problem but the process was treated as if I had ordered the wrong part and was my fault.  I had to pay the shipping costs to return the part and then was charged a re-stocking fee.  That was bad enough but I had a feeling that the information about the problem part would be lost and the part would be returned to the shelf and re-sold, causing the same problem for the next person.  This suspicion was confirmed when I was ready to install the water pump I bought from PartsGeek.  When I received the pump via UPS I had opened the box and took a quick look inside and the pump looked fine.   The part sat in the box while I worked on the engine.  When I finally took the part out I realized that it had been sold to someone before - there were bolt/washer pressure marks on the install holes - and been returned.  The problem was that the pump had been returned with the first buyer\\'s used, rusty and brittle O-ring and no one at PartsGeek bothered to notice.\\r\\nMy bad experiences would not have happened if  PartsGeek had an effective Customer Service department where a customer can contact a real, live person on the phone an discuss and resolve problems.  Until PartsGeek does this I will not buy parts from them and will caution others to do the same.\\nVery good products and services. It\\'s a pleasure doing business with Mr. Cook.\\nI am very happy with Agoda and Almassa\\nCasheNetUSA has been a life saver on so many occasions.  There are no hidden fees.\\nI have been using these pens for years now as advertising and gifts to clients.  They are always well received with many clients commenting on how easy  am to contact because my information is right in their hand.  I also like that as thing evolve they keep up.  The addition of the stylus was great, I like many of my clients have fingers to large for many of the keyboards the the new phones.\\nCompletely and utterly terrible and unacceptable my dress came in a box which was completely wrecked my dress was torn the strap had fallen off and threads were coming out all over I will never use this site again and will do everything in my power to prevent others from using this site I feel as though I was scammed\\nFrom initial order to installation... everything went very well and our mirror looks fantastic.\\nI\\'m turning 70 in a few days and really wanted to have some friends join me to celebrate this important day in my life. I happened upon Greenvelope site and while it was a little challenging for me, totally because I\\'m not as computer savey as younger people are. The invitations turned out perfect and I was able to keep up with who had opened the evites and who responded. Greenvelope notified me each day with any activity on my account. I had a 99% response which I thought was great. Each time I ran into a problem (which was often) someone was available to guide me through my issue. I highly recommend them to send your invitations in a very professional way at a very reasonable price! Thank you Greenvelope!\\nI have ordered from this place before, and have never had a problem, so when I saw they had all 5 of my required textbooks for class, I jumped on that. That being said, I ave never had such poor service when dealing with any other site in general as I have with this particular order. I was given a tracking device, like most book renting companies do, and every once in a while I would check on it. That is until the tracking number stated my books were delivered... to Tennesesee. The last time I was in Tennessee was when I was about 14, and just passing through. I contacted the site via email (because this site does not offer a phone number) explaining my concerns. I received an email back essentially saying I could not complain about my books not being delivered until the estimated delivery time expired, even though my tracking number has updated to \"DELIVERED\". So I waited until I had time to contact them again (a day later) via chat. The customer service rep told me yes, the books were delivered to Tennessee, but he can\\'t do anything about it (weather that be reimburse me or re-sending the textbooks) until the delivery date expired. He then told me to contact USPS about my shipment. After 45 minutes of talking to a robot, I finally got a person on the phone who told me the exact same this as everyone else, except he would try to resend the package, but I should just wait until the USPS in Tennessee calls me because they have my books. I called them, they say the books have been sent back to the original address from which they were shipped because they don\\'t hold packages. Class has already started, and I need these books for homework and studying purposes, which is why I ordered them before class started. If I get my books (and I mean if) I sincerely doubt I will be renting from this site again.\\nI enjoyed the online experience of ordering directly from Dior.  I especially enjoyed being able to sample other products that are often not offered in the Department Stores.\\nOrdering was easy, delivery was prompt. I was impressed by the quality of the dress, my daughter loves it. Yes, some of the sparkles come off of the top, but not a big deal in my opinion. Would order from SimplyDresses again!!\\nExcellent sevice on a new tire (4) purchase\\nI am very happy with the front rotors and pads I received from you. I beleive that your spot on with quality, price and shipping time.\\nService is great. Prices are reasonable. Auctions are fun. Items are almost always described and graded accurately. For some reason, I have gotten several comics from Lone Star where one of the bottom corners of the book is bent. Like they were dropped somewhere along the line either when being put into their inventory or packing to be shipped out.\\nThe course is user friendly. I was happy to be able to take the course from my home. I would recommend it.\\nTypically we park in the Valet parking garage for shorter jaunts we take......3-7 days.  For our almost 3week trip I decided to attempt to save a bit so chose the WP outdoor lot on PAC Ave and 188th.\\n\\nI was a little nervous leaving our car outside in a fenced lot.  I prepaid the stay, arrived, found a parking spot and the pickup van was there to take us to the airport.\\n\\nUpon our return, after flying over 14 hous, we had to wait a bit for the van, but our car was secure, check out was easy and the service was great.\\n\\nI appreciate the choices with WP.....you can go first class with Valet, washing, changing oil etc. or park outside in a safe and secure lot.  Parking at the airport isn’t cheap but WP makes it affordable with great services ce.\\nGreat product for the money.\\nI ordered through PartsGeek and my order was delivered fast and correct. Thanks PartsGeek!!\\nI appreciated the attention and advice that Manny, Service Mgr and Freddie, Store Mgr gave me. Had a little problem with getting the correct front brake pads for 2006 MB E350 which took some time tobresolve. Got a good deal on Toyo Extensa tires with extended services. Definitely will return.\\nI\\'m currently living on outside the continental USA and trying to gift my loved ones with something that is useful and convenient, like a VISA/MASTERCARD gift card, is great!! No many giftcard website allows APO/AE address, I love that giftcards.com does.\\nI just loved every single part of my rental in Rome\\nShipping was fast - everything fit well. I ordered two shirts and two bumper stickers - one of which I designed.  The site was easy to use.  I had no issues getting the items quickly.  My only reservation is that when I went back to find one of the shirts, it was gone.  So I couldn\\'t order another or if a friend wanted one they couldn\\'t have ordered another.  I haven\\'t done research so I don\\'t know how long they keep things up on their site.  Other than that - the experience was great.  I\\'m sure I will order more things from them in the future.\\nI\\'ve been using career builder services for a few years now and I have have fast responses from employers.\\nIf you don\\'t know exactly what you want, navigating sites like these can be a nightmare.  The site creators did a very good job with this one, I think.  The \"Quick View\" is an excellent feature, although I would add to it perhaps a short snippet from the product\\'s description and the ability to see more or all of the photos, not just one large photo.  When people post items for sale, perhaps there could be a short \"Quick View description\" that they write which will be shown.\\n\\nOverall, it was very easy to find what I wanted.  The only difficulty was on account of the many choices, but who could complain about that?\\nHelpful, friendly and didn\\'t give me any problems . Got my refund very quickly\\nEverything is always wonderful!!\\nMy order took over a week to get to my door. I live in a city too.\\nfast shipment, prices beyond amazing \\nthank you\\nHas of the time of this review I have not received my merchandise. It\\'s on the way to my home. The customer service is outstanding. They worked with me on my purchase and gave me an excellent deal. Everything that was agreed upon happened. Great people to deal with. Don\\'t hesitate on a purchase. Top quality gear for reasonable prices.\\nGood service, Perfect stuff, 5/5.\\nEmployed now thanks to your website.\\nPrompt, courteous, friendly service. Clear directions. Safe. Reasonable prices- no hidden charges.\\nother than the 100 bucks worth of service fees great\\nbest music old and new from over the world\\nI am in love with the product and  the purchasing experience! Thank you!\\nThe best Team Building activity we\\'ve ever done. TeamBonding was flexible and helped us schedule an activity at the last minute. They were very cooperative and the facilitators were down-to-earth and personable. We did the Teddy Rescue Bear (Build a Teddy Bear) activity and it was lots of fun. I would definitely do it again or try one of the other activities. The best parts are the games, puzzles, and trivia you have to complete to gain experience for the specific activity\\nParts were reasonable price and one part missed component due to packing in warehouse. It came with missing component, but they credited the amount as it was very cheap under $10. Overall. I think it looks great and hope to review other part performance when mechanic places it. One thing I must want is the longer warranty on struts and shocks than a year, but that might be standard warranty time at other places too.\\nThe amount of required info is kind of insane compared to any other site where you can purchase games from. I thought it was fake, and had to do a lot of digging to see if others had used the site before and if they could confirm it being genuine. Luckily, this is a real site, but customers shouldn\\'t have to second guess like that.\\nFor the price the shipping can\\'t be complained and the products are great\\nThis is the best way for me to shop for Ink, they give me the same quality of ink as the name brand for my printer! and their prices are great!\\nGreat Service - Great Drivers!\\nThe food is excellent and the recipes have all been tasty.  I love that I can pick the meals and I have a large chunk of my meal planning done along with the groceries for the meals.  Great way to get more balance to the diet and not to mention great way to try new foods that I may have shied away from before.\\nI can\\'t speak to the building of it as it was a gift for my nephew, but he loved it!\\nGreat help and nice website!!\\nI had an amazing experience. Quicken is always there to answer your questions. It\\'s really easy to get your loan process going because it\\'s all online. I had 3 people helping me with the different levels of the loan process Anthony, Greg and Tiffany. They were all very helpful, friendly and super efficient. I am a first time home buyer and Quicken make me feel very comfortable with the whole process. I would highly recommend them!!!\\nDeep discount on quality shoes, easy web site, free shipping, on time delivery. What\\'s not to love!\\nMy Experience with Rover has been a very positive one.  I have been very happy with the service Rover has provided me in helping me find Exceptional Daycare for my pet during the day while I work.  I could not of been happier with the care that we were provided.  My Pet was happy and always extremely well care for in a family setting with a wonderful loving family.  Rover kept in touch with me through emails and followed my pets care with updates.  The process of booking and payment was safe quick and easy.  I would not hesitate in recommending Rovers services.\\nWe have accidentally set the alarm off twice.  They have been very prompt in responding.  This gives me confidence in knowing that if the alarm is real, their response will be prompt.  It gives me peace of mind knowing they are looking after my home.\\neveryone was pleasant and respectful was a great experience\\nI spoke with Mr Patrick Wallace, the talk since the begining was not just friendly, was direct, clear answers, clear questions, not cutting corners, I told Patrick what I need , Patrick told me what he need it, and with that info, I got my proposal withing few hours. That is the way I like to do business. Good Job Mr Wallace. Thank you.\\nGot a very good ticket for a very cheap price.\\nPart arrived quickly and was exactly what was needed. Price was good and made the repairs without the hassle of shop labor draining my wallet, I never did much electrical work before, but the right part helped make it easy.\\nGood service, I just wish their re-order system was a little easier to use. But they have dedicated reps, so if you get in a bind they can help.\\nHave called numerous times about various things and the guys at pro civic are always willing to help and answer question. Delivery is fast and hassle free and I love how I can use PayPal. Keep up the good work fellas!\\nPricing was competitive and booking was easy.\\nPOP Yachts was very professional at every point of the sale.\\nNice site and best of buy games\\nI didn\\'t expect it to be so quick. Thank you again...\\nAs a business owner I appreciate and value good employees, Especially those employees that go above and beyond the call of duty. Mike Scott offered what I consider was excellent service from start to finish.\\nI have purchased of free people several times and never have i been so disappointed as i was today opening my latest parcel.  Firstly since when does it take two and a half weeks for a parcel to be sent from Victoria Australia to NSW. Joke! I found a huge difference in the styling of a couple of my items compared to the Photographs on line so much so i actually do not like the items i purchased and will be returning them for a complete refund.  One piece in particular i was discusted with, the mock dress mini a classic black number, however i soon discovered once i tried it one had an extremely obvious inch cut out hole on the front of it that appeared to have once had a mending patch placed over it and another large hole in the seam.  How was this still sent out to a customer? I love the style of the black dress but will not be exchanging it for another instead ill be getting a full refund because i don\\'t want to be messed around any more.  I will be extremely careful if i purchase from free people again.\\nMy agent took care of me when other companies didn\\'t want to insure me they did and even cheaper\\nEasy to browse around the site, listen to samples, and great to purchase and shop high quality work. Will continue my business here.\\npet food arrived VERY quickly, faster than expected and very well packaged\\nLoved everything that I ordered!\\nI purchased a TRX-1 from Zip Scanners and had questions right away as I was getting error messages. I was glad that I bought from this company as I was able to call them and get assistance. No holds, no wait time, great service!\\nAs far as the unit, after several months it is a strange relationship. There are things about it that I like and things that I don\\'t. Mostly, I don\\'t trust it. \\nThe reason that I bought it was for portable use. I like the fact that even with the rubber case on, I can cary it in my work shirt pocket. I may look strange but it is where I am able to hear it and with the rubber case, I do not have to worry about it falling out when I bend over. Zip Scanners programed it for my county and that is great! I have a Uniden Home Patrol 1 and Home Patrol 2 also the BCD 536. I feel that the Bearcat products are more reliable and I know that when I turn them on, they will work. The only thing I do not like with the Unidens is that they scan a lot that I can not seem to get rid of, such is state police which is encrypted and not scanable, plus forest service and many others that are not applicable for my area even with rhe range set to a low 0 to 5 miles. It will keep stopping on these frequencies and when I lock them out, every time I update the database, they come back.  With the TRX-1, every time I turn it on, I hold my breath, wondering if it will start or if I will receive an error message and be stuck with a dead expensive brick!\\n I have no fear with the Uniden units as they have worked from first power up every time. Not so with the TRX-1. I purchased the TRX-1 to use as a portable as the HP-1 and HP-2 are a hard size to carry around mobile.  \\nThe TRX-1 eats batteries like crazy. I will only get about three hours of continuous scanning on a set of 2800 rechargeable batteries.  I had hoped for a entire 8 hour days worth of scanning. Also the battery meter works well until the halfway point then within 5 min. the batteries are dead and the unit shuts off with no warning. I worry that the SD card will get corrupted when this happens.  The Uniden\\'s have much longer battery life. they can run for well over a day on the same battery type.  With the Uniden\\'s, you can pick the battery rating and it will tell you how many hours it will take to charge a battery with that rating The Whistler on the other hand has numbers that you can set but I have no way of knowing if you set it for say 20 - is it going to charge for 20 min, 20 hours, or 20 days. No way to know. If I set the TRX-1 for what the Uniden tells me to set for that battery, It will only last an hour before going dead. Leaving the TRX-1 at the setting it came with will take three days to charge the batteries in the unit. Not acceptable for me. Listen for 3 hours and charge for three days! I worry about the batteries exploding in the unit. I have been told to remove the batteries and charge them in a charger which is easy on the Uniden\\'s but try taking the rubber case on and off the TRX-1 several times a day! I want the protection that case offers in case I drop it on concrete like I did with my Home Patrol 2. The case on cracked but it still works perfectly.  \\nI work in a Three story office building with tinted glass windows. With any of my Bearcats, I can remove the rubber ducky antenna and still receive most transmissions. The same is true in the car or at home. With the TRX-1 you will receive nothing with the antenna removed.\\nI should have returned the TRX-1 as I believe the Unidens are a much better quality radio and easier to use. They have a color screen that is lit all the time and give a better description of what you are listening to in a larger format. The TRX-1 must have the backlight shut off to save on batteries so unless bright sunlight hits the screen most of the time you have no clue what you are listening to except for the brief time it lights when it stops on something. \\nYet there is something about it that makes me keep it, even though I never know if it will work when I turn it on. I think it is the size and the one county programming plus it does receive modes that the Uniden\\'s do not. \\nI may regret it when it quits altogether but for now, dispite it\\'s faults I am keeping it although I do like the Uniden products better as far as ease of use, readability of display, and build quality.\\nThe person went out of their way to help me on the phone the only reason they are getting 5 stars. is a few things that they promised didn\\'t come through on my order. But over all he was great even called me back after we got disconnected!\\nThe Photon Light that I ordered is a very nice quality piece of equipment.  The price was right and the shipping was fast!  Photonlight.com definitely has my future business.\\nBundle Stars always provided me some of the best deals around the Web. It definitely is one of my favorite game provider amongst many others including Steam, Humble bundle and gog!\\n\\nGreat deals, great service, never had the slightest problem with them !\\nNo problems what so ever as of now\\nGreat service and fast admin service...\\nSince I have no time to shop in the stores it is important for me to get the product that I order in a timely manner and at a good price.\\nI had multiple contacts with Summer In Italy.  All were very positive.  The responses I received, even late in the day, were very prompt and complete.\\nDaniel managed to change the name on our flights at the last minute so my husband could take his friend instead when my disc prolapse relapsed. He was friendly, efficient, respectful and stepped up to the mark to turn our run of bad luck into a well deserved break for my husband. Daniel is a STAR.\\nPS 1 is like very old school. We are talking about almost 17 years. This was my first system as a kid. And all the games that I used to play are priceless. I never had any toys but video games are those that I still have in my mind. Playing old psone games again brings back those childhood memories of eating junk food and just relaxing after school on the couch.\\nI like Moos\\'s product line, which has brought me back a number of times. There have been quality issues that seem to be glossed over when I mention them. I bring them up for two reasons. One, because my products was less than expected. And two, because I had the impression that Moo was interested in feedback. I\\'ve since learned this really isn\\'t the case. Not necessarily a bad thing, but not what I expected from the general tone of the company.\\nI bought a 2 yr plan on a printer.  2 yrs later when the printer stopped working I just happened to remember that I bought a service plan. When I called Square Trade, Izzy politely informed me that my contract expired 3 weeks prior! Ugh! It figures...always the consumer gets the short end of the deal in situations like this. However, It turned out NOT THIS TIME! HaHa! Izzy talked to his supervisor and he approved 100% of my original cost!!! UNBELIEVABLE! Izzy skillfully led me through the procedure with lightning speed and I received my check 2 days later! Square Trade is amazing! And so was Izzy!!! :) I\\'m a Square Trade customer for life!\\nI love the styles, but there just aren\\'t enough in big sizes. While I would not go out in public in leggings at my current size, I actually need this type products. It would be more encouraging to my workout dedication if I could bolster my self-esteem with a cute outfit. Sizes will get smaller as I go along, but it\\'s hard in the beginning. I was paired with outfits of xxs tops and 3x bottoms. Very frustrating. Also, sold out color choices could be more clearly identified.\\nI have spoken with Brandon several times for several trips that we have taken insurance out for and he was extremely courteous, respectful, patient and supportive.  I  would definitely recommend this company to any friends and family that may be taking trips.\\nStaff was knowledgeable and helpful. Very friendly! The wait for walk in service was reasonable. Overall smooth experience. I will definitely be a returning customer.\\nThe citypass made it so much easier for my family and I to see many of Toronto\\'s beautiful tourist locations without breaking the bank.\\nExpedia charged me over $50 for a so-called \"Travel Protection Plan\".  But when I had to cancel my flight due to unforeseen circumstances, I was told that I couldn\\'t get a refund unless there is a death in the family or there\\'s a medical condition for which there has to be a note from a doctor to show that the traveler is unable to travel.  So, prospective travelers, unless you do expect a death in your family or some serious medical conditions during your planned travel, don\\'t spend a penny on that useless \"travel protection plan\", and better yet, don\\'t use Expedia for your travel needs.  Instead, contact the airlines, rental car companies, and hotels directly.  With those merchants, you tend to have greater flexibility.\\nI ordered limiting straps three weeks ago and still haven\\'t received my item. I ordered the straps and the website said they will ship in a business day or two. I called 4 wheel parts a week later because I still hadn\\'t relieved a tracking number and they stated it was on two week back order which they never informed me of. I had to call to get this information, not even a email was sent. I have called back in the weeks following and every time, customer service tells me \"two more weeks\" even though 3 weeks have already passed. I will NEVER to business with 4 wheel parts again and wouldn\\'t recommend them to anyone. Highly dissatisfied!\\nJenson has all the parts at the best prices. I have purchased from them\\nfor quite a few years now..\\nI bought 3 different beds for my family and we are very satisfied with the quality and price along with an informed and helpful staff.\\nItem was just as described, shipping was quick. I have no issues ! Great place to buy parts.\\nGood services\\nThe quick service was great. But I got one used book that was in very poor condition--looked like a child drew a circle with a pen on each page. It was just for home reference, and a good price, but I was sort of surprised that this book was even sold. I\\'m glad I wasn\\'t planning to give it as a gift, as I was one of the other used books I ordered, that was in great shape! So, sort of mixed results for me from my order. : /\\nThe delivery drivers are clueless and lazy even Though every time i give them instructions to get to my gate and door i have to walk out of my house to the gate and have my food handed to me over a gate. And am still forced to give a tip.\\nThis is the second time that I have used MeMD and the it was the same doctor for both remote consultations. Both times it was within an hour after calling the service that I received a call from the doctor. Each time the visit was efficient, effective and resulted in a prescription that help my health condition. I have recommended the service to several of my coworkers.\\nThe hardware was exactly what we needed as replacement hinges for our bathroom cabinet. The site guided us to the right set of replacement hinges for a broken set that didn\\'t exist any longer. It was accurate and delivery was timely.

Service by Springer was great!!\\nWe were very pleased with the price and the fact that we were able to find just the flight we needed was great!\\nReliable, easy, and good rate. 3day-free option is real cost-saving!\\nThe band, Reign, totally flaked out on my event!  They left me high and dry.  I am so disappointed that they ruined my party.  They won\\'t even follow through with their bad choice behavior.  If I were you, I would not have them on my website to represent your name.  They contacted me ONCE, not even on the day of my event did they have the NERVE to admit they were not coming and I haven\\'t heard from them since!\\nVery up to date listings easy to use app\\nEasy to order books from Thrift Books: and books are in good condition!\\nI want to thank Mike for his courteous, informative & personal attention to my tire dilemna.  He made me feel like a valued customer.  I am one who will be returning to Town Fair Tire.  Please reward employees like Mike, as they are a rare commodity today.\\nAlways the best customer service given at the Sherman Oaks location!!\\nOkay.. like this was the fastest most convenient loan I\\'ve ever applied for. And I did it on my cell phone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the next day Ito was in my account. I can finally get this wedding ring for my girlfriend....!! \\r\\n\\r\\nLike great idea. And great company so far...\\nHonestly I didn\\'t believe it could be that easy!! I types in my books and the website told me a price (which was much higher than other sites) and then I printed the barcode off and went to a UPS store and WALLA!!! Done. Then a check a week later! Keeping this website for all my future classes. So excited to actually sell my books back! Thanks!\\nAfter speaking to numerous Customerr Service Agents, I was finally able to get a Supervisor on the phone.  I was trying to access a confirmation for one of the numerous flights I\\'ve booked in 2015.   The attendants were putting me on hold for excessive periods of time, I was shuffled around 3 times and my dilemma was not being resolved.  The outcome demonstrated excellent Public Relation, understanding and professionalism.  \"Hawk\", the Supervisor, listened attentively and  was able to satisfactorily solve the problem.  It was a long process, but well worth the expertise I finally received.\\nThey fixed my ipod Nano 2nd gen very quickly, then promptly returned it to me. Upon receiving it I could clearly see they went to great lengths to ensure its safe travel. I removed it from the packaging, to see it had been placed in a sealed pocket of bubble wrap, once I removed it from that it had been tightly wrapped not once, twice, but three times in even more bubble wrap, that ipod wasn\\'t going anywhere during shipping thanks to all that bubble wrap. 10/10 Would do business here again.\\nComments as in the title\\nI appreciate all the simple, easy-to-read facts that CompareCards offer.  Each week CompareCards presents articles to teach the average consumer, like myself,  pros and cons of the credit card.

Have to give a review later.\\nProduct was exactly what I was looking for.\\nI ordered a houndstooth scarf and after inspection, I realized there was a hole.  I called Scarves.com and was pleased with the customer service.  They apologized and promised to send out a replacement scarf that same day free of charge.  However, when the postman rang my doorbell, he told me that Scarves.com paid for one pound of postage, but that my scarf was over a pound and that I needed to pay $1 before he would give me my scarf.  Interesting!....\\nI love Dial 7. Our first time in NYC and we wanted a reliable car service to take us to the airport. We checked the reviews of Dial 7 and were not disappointed. They are prompt, reliable and polite. I\\'ve used them 3 times already since my arrival and plan to use again. Cars are immaculately clean and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this car service.\\nThe first time we went to Ireland we used Groupon, but then decided to go straight to the source of the great deal for the rest of the traveling deals. Neither time did we have ANY problems with reservations, things not being booked or paid for, nothing. The whole trip was seamless. I highly recommend this website to anyone who asks us about our travels or to anyone looking to travel with the types of deals that Great Value provides. For someone with wanderlust this website and the continual deals they have to ALL OVER THE WORLD is just an amazing thing to have coming to my inbox once a week. Their customer service has been impeccable and I can\\'t wait until our next adventure with Great Value.\\nThey arrived fast and completely correct and at a fair price.\\nGreat selection. Husband loved the sweatshirt. Fast shipment.\\nMary and Matt are the best. Kind of last minute and they welcomed our Ringo with open arms. We are very comfortable with leaving our pets in their care.

The night before it\\'s supposed to be delivered I get an email stating a time for the next day- I had a doctors appointment for that time - called to ask for a later delivery time and was told I have to wait another WEEK for my chair and STILL I WASNT GIVEN ANY OPTIONS FOR TIMES.  Hoping I\\'m able to get delivery of chair sometime this month... Won\\'t be ordering from there again.\\nI always use WallyPark and their service is good, especially the drivers and parking staff.

Package tracking not included with lowest cost shipping. Had no difficulties. Gave four stars, not five, because other sources offer extras. Used this one to try it as a source. Would use again\\nHonestly in the past i have bought fifa 14 coins and i had no problems with that , now i have just bought fifa 17 and fifa points and i\\'ve recieved that in less than 5 minutes.\\n\\nI would recommend Mmoga to everybody!\\nI had a few orders on mango on some sale periods and the clothes and  shoes I bought are of a good quality at a reasonable price. Though, the sizing isn\\'t always true. For example, a pair of jeans size 36 were a bit loose for me and a pair of non-stretchy trousers size 36 did not fit at all, being too small. Anyway, that\\'s the risks you are taking into consideration when you shop online and you can always consider returns (or a skinny friend).\\nI had to move my car from Dublin, Ohio to Dallas , Texas as I recently moved to Texas..I was staying in a hotel and I needed my car to be delivered before I leave the hotel.

Dashboard is great and easy to use.\\nThe product arrived very quickly but I feel like it should have been packed with a cold pack. I ordered probiotic and on the infant formula, it clearly says to keep refrigerated. Other suppliers have always sent it with a cold pack so I am a little concerned that it lost potency in the hot travel here.\\nMy order shipped the next day and I love what I purchased!\\nOutstanding customer service.

Would definitely recommend Geneseo Mavis .\\nFast and easy way to rent a car ... thx\\nnice/ i dont know what write)))\\nI recommend that everyone sign up for Goldstar!

Being a Red Velvet member has enabled me to get the best seats at a great price...so glad a friend recommended Goldstar to me. Join now!!\\nEasy to use. Staff is very helpful.  We did as many revisions as we needed to with no issues.\\nI shopped around quite a bit to replace a sofa, chair and ottoman and had never bought online before, only from a local retailer. I knew what I wanted and had a limited budget, but from the very first contact Ben @Sofas and Sectionals was nothing but very professional, SUPER prompt answering all my questions and they quoted the best price of all my options!  Every promise made was kept - price, product, quality, delivery, follow ups and even customer service!  When I inquired about delivery the rep was detailed and specific and spot on estimating when I would be called to be scheduled! Ben and the staff won my trust and my business, and I would recommend them highly! It was worth the 6 week wait to get exactly what I wanted and I know it will last a long time!  Great company to work with and great products!\\nProduct very good and competitive price. Delivery no problem.

Such dedication, working so late!\\n\\nThe grapefruit are fantastic.  You have just gained a lifetime customer.  Please note though that I am 81, so that\\'s not a real big offer for you.\\nI have been using WallyPark for our last 3 trips and love it! They cater to their customers and it is so nice to come back to a warm car in the cold winter months. My only complaint is that I did request covered valet and I am sure it was not covered by how dirty the car was. The valet also changed my radio station and had some hip hop station blaring when I got into the car. Not a big deal but I really see no reason to mess with the radio in patron\\'s cars. I will continue to use WallyPark for all my trips especially if I can get a groupon deal to lower the price.\\nthe best ever! fast and convenient!\\nJohanna Jablon helped me with getting my passport renewed.

We had to constantly re-login to the wifi. The picture on the very old TV was not clear. The people in the office were not at all helpful in recommending local places for dinner or breakfast. We opted for one room key rather than spend $5 for a second key. Not very good value for $90.\\nI\\'m short on time to elaborate.

The place is relatively clean and fairly well managed, but it lacks conveniences.  For example, the doors to the climate-controlled building does not have a proper ramp.  So, you struggle to bring the cart from the entrance to the building.  Secondly, after-hours access is a separate request that you have to make.  Overall, it is worth your time and money.\\nI was happy to find exactly what we were looking for, although it was a bit pricey. The product then arrived damaged, which was disappointing. However, the customer service was great to work with and promptly sent a new product. Overall it was a good experience and I hope the quality holds up.\\nDxL is a good place to shop they always have your correct size and if the store don\\'t have ot the salesperson will do it\\'s best to get the most.

I will soon be leaving then as a customer.\\nWe were fortunate to have had a competent, qualified representative who took the time to thoroughly explain things and clarify the many questions that arose throughout our Medicare research.  By the time we signed on, my spouse and I both felt much more comfortable than when we started the process.\\nTheir product is extremely awesome.The customer service is fast & excellent and shipping price is low. You can contact them for any info you need. They are helpful.\\nEvery time I return to supplement warehouse I check all the products i\\'m going to purchase with other well known supplement suppliers. Only a few times have I had to adjust the price for a lower price I\\'ve found. thanks S.W. for the great prices!!\\nI recently purchased some stickers from Cafe Express. They were very unique. They were shipped promptly and arrived as pictured. I would buy from again and would recommend them as well. A+ all the way.\\nHave had excellent service an have recommended your site to others\\nI was very weary on purchasing a dress from an online site. Especially after hearing so many horror stories.. but after doing lots of research and reading a few reviews on the actual site I decided to go ahead with it. Got my package today. Was shipped from New Jersey. Ordered it on a Thursday night and the dress arrived on Tuesday by UPS. Beautifully and carefully wrapped. Dress came on a hanger and wrapped in plastic! Fun little thank you note inside.  Dress looks just like the pictures and fits true to sizes on size chart! It\\'s so soft! I\\'m thoroughly pleased! Will definitely be ordering from simplydresses.com again!\\n\\nI\\'d also like to add.. this is a 100% unbiased review. I was not compensated in any way to post this. (I\\'m also always so unsure about reviews as well. Lol).\\nThe instructor was knowledgeable, provided current and ready-to-use resources and tools, and the materials were well organized.\\nThe book was not what I Expected! I know it was a used book, paperback, but it was falling apart at the binder seams! It had to tape it up just to keep it together! Not happy!\\r\\n\\r\\nR. Dennis\\r\\nTexas\\nI didn\\'t like that the offer of free shipping was rendered null and void because the items were on sale.  i would have saved more had they been regular price and I could have the free shipping.  I felt that this was done on purpose.\\nDelivery from their many warehouses is prompt and without worry. Glad to have this sight. Thanx, Lance\\nI was excited to stumble across Thrift Books and find so many books for extremely low prices. I really like the idea of buying previously loved books, instead of brand new books, and the reward points system is a great idea. There was some confusion over my first two orders, but the person I called was able to clear it up efficiently and courteously. I will definitely be shopping on this website again.\\nFast response! Effective solution! Competitive price! I highly recommended doctorSIM!\\nEverything was great. Will be a returning customer.\\nexcellent.....\\nLanded around 1am at O\\'hare. After following the instructions on the slip and texting WallyPark (I received a response), it took them over an hour to come and get us. We called multiple times and received a not-so-polite response from the woman at the front desk. Then, they wanted to charge us an extra hour when it was their fault that our car was there for an extra hour.\\nI used to go to Supplement Warehouse when I lived in Wisconsin, and because they are such a great company I kept ordering from them after I left the state for the military and was stationed in California. Their shipping is always fast, their selection is huge, and their price match is great! Would recommend to anyone looking for quality supplements at a good price.\\nRegenexx is a company of excellence. Every possible step is taken to maximize success for the patient. The procedures used by Regenexx are superior to numerous other companies which I have personally researched. Traditional surgery was counter-productive for me. I am so grateful for the folks at Regenexx for restoring the use of my knee to \\nnormal function. 65 year old female.\\nI ordered two items, and received an email two days later that my items have shipped. I opened the email only to find that the one item was cancelled because it was out of stock. I went onto their website and saw that the item said it was in stock, so I called to see whether they would be able to fulfill my order. After being on hold for quite some time a woman answered and rudely told me she needed my credit card number to order the item that was in fact in stock. After I got off of the phone with the woman, I added up the two separate amounts I paid and realized I was paying more than I was initially. After calling back and waiting again, the woman put me on hold to check why the prices were different. She then preceded to tell me that it was their mistake and that I should have paid more initially, but that it was their problem. However, she said that the new total was correct. I told her that I did not think it was fair that I pay more when it was their mistake, but she could care less. I said that I was very unhappy and that it was not right of them to do and that I wouldn\\'t be ordering from them again, and she responded with \"Go talk.\" Never have I ever dealt with such horrible customer service. Don\\'t order from this company, nobody should be treated so disrespectfully.\\nThis business model is maddening. It is absolutely ridiculous that if I forget to \"skip the month\", the credit that I receive cannot be applied to sale items. It\\'s marketed like it\\'s a great thing to have a credit, but it\\'s a punishment. I could not wait to use up my credit and then cancel.\\nI rarely order, but when I do everything fits great and I love the styles! I just wish they didn\\'t rotate so quickly because I can\\'t afford to order all the time and they run out of what I love so fast.\\nThe team of Hubert and Ron was excellent and thorough.  They stayed until the job was done and not by the clock.\\nMade reservation without an issue.\\nso far so good!!!\\nWe had the most amazing event because of the entertainment. I just plugged into GigMasters and got so many offers from talented, colorful performers. The hardest part was trying to pick which two I could hire. They all respected my budget and were responsive to all emails and phone calls. I have shared this site with many people and appreciate how easy it was to plan our celebration in a very short period of time. Nearly 200 hundred people for dinner. A great time was had by all!!\\r\\nThank you\\nI  was not exactly sure which A/C blower motor I needed so I called Dyers (2006 Monaco Dynasty with two 15K Dometic/Penguin heat pump units). Their technical sales people made sure the motor I needed was the one they sold me. It was delivered fast and with the included installation instructions which were easy to follow, it probably took about 2 1/2 hours from start to finish to remove the old and install the new. It works great and is nice and quite - thanks Dyers!\\nOMG!!!!! Love this wig!!!!!  so much like my real hair I forget its not mine!!!!  just talked too a friend who will be ordering one for herself soon!!!!!!!\\nProfessional and efficient. Got a fair price.

I was referred by a friend and can\\'t wait to get everything in!\\nHello Fresh ingredients are top notch.  The meals are packaged well.  The ingredients are top of the line and the recipes are easy to follow resulting in a delicious meal.  We look forward to our meals each week and have found the Customer Service to be exceptional.\\nI bought a Garmin 45 dash cam, they charged me on my credit card, but I never received the camera, instead they returned it to themselves, they reversed the credit card transaction, and never gave an explanation of what they did or why they did it. The one thing I know is that I lost a $15 coupon that I used for the purchase, because they didn\\'t return that.\\nMerlin R was awesome! So helpful and sorted out my issue within a couple of minutes!\\nThanks again!\\nI talked with someone and was told based on the answers to questions I was asked that I qualified for a loan. I asked for $2500 and I was told I qualified for $4,500 which was great! Well, Jessica Hakenson emailed me to fax my docs so she could deposit the funds. When I did, I had to call repeatedly before I rec\\'d a cb from her. I had to email all my docs to her again. Then, she emailed me at 7:00 am pst to tell me I couldn\\'t have the loan due to my bank act being overdrawn in the month. I have overdraft protection plus another bank. I wasn\\'t even asked what happened. You are not a reputable company. I\\'d hate to think when you saw my driver\\'s license, you changed your mind. I don\\'t believe any positive reviews.\\nI really like EZ Cater!  The service is great, and I love the rewards.\\nI am always checking flights to fly home for holidays or vacation and Just Fly was a quick and easy way to compare cheapest flights and book. I would book with them again in a heartbeat!\\nGood list of contractors who were not in our phone book.  Timely referral to Reidhead plumbing.\\nLoved product!

I wish 1 luggage was included without the additional cost but I would recommend justfly now to friends and family.\\nMy order arrived fast and ordering was easy. The issue I have is the ink was leaking and some of the colors weren\\'t full. I had the same issue the first time I received an order from them. Other then that the ink was good, the price was ok and my order was correct.\\nVery good experience. Help requested provided in a timely manner.\\nI was locked out of my account for an unknown reason.  Then, when I went to reset my password, I was told to contact the company.  When I contacted them, they asked for my Pay Pal account and credit card information.  I have never given that information out and now all of a sudden they wanted me to cough it up.  Something sounds very very dishonest in their pursuits.  I reluctantly gave them my Pay Pal account information and told them that I was minus (which was true).  Then, on February 1, 2016, a CSR by the name of Arielle said I was banned for life and my account forever locked out.  This was a result of my trying to get into my account...how is that for customer service.\\r\\n\\r\\nNasty customer service who I think are very shady and dishonest!  Don\\'t bother giving them your business!  There are plethora of other reputable companies on the internet that you can go for sources of vacations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, feel free to file a complaint against this company with the BBB, FTC, District Attorney\\'s Office, and anyone else you can find!  Here is their contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\nAirbnb, Inc.\\r\\nCEO: Brian Chesky\\r\\n888 Brannan St., 4th Floor\\r\\nSan Francisco,   CA   94103\\r\\n(415) 728-0000\\nDatabase contains so many duplicates or outdated email addresses that only about 1/2 of the contacts that I sent our PR to were good. \\nThat said, their customer service reps were \"above average\" responsive.\\nDecent price and service. Discount offering on the website didn\\'t work but I found a discount code on the internet so it only amounted to a couple bucks.\\nMy phone was sent in on a Monday early evening. I recieved it back at 9:30 am Wednesday morning. My phone looked great and everything worked perfectly. I will definitely use square trade for my future devices.\\nI use the site for many things from internet searches to watching tv to shopping. They always pay.\\nI receive my item and I installed it and it was able to and it works good I\\'m glad I found it on the internet and I bought it from you thank you\\nI am supposed to give a negative star because this cargo company is CHEAP!!!!! UPS does not have money to pay or does not pay for the import duties and taxes with the item arriving at the NAIA airport in the Philippines!!! Worst they make this more complicated than simple!!!! This is my experience with this worst cargo company!!!!! When you are in the Philippines and a shopaholic or internet shopping addict, look for a shopping network with the cargo forwarder that pay in advance the import duties and taxes and this good cargo company is DHL.\\nThank You,  I would buy from  you again.\\nThey have always been there for me, if its just a little to tide me over until payday, or something bigger for other reasons.  Their website is very user friendly and I love the perks of the discounts!  I consider them a \"friend\".\\nLove the coins, love the experience, fast shipping. cant say enough about this company. I love doing business with them!!!!\\nFirst time ordering  and experienced  the worst customer service. They give you one price over the phone and charge  a different  price online. Also, didn\\'t  get all the parts I have ordered  as a kit and they tried to sell separately when I called them after receiving  a partial shipment. Would have been so much better and faster  to go to the local part store. Learned a  lesson after been through  all these hassles.\\nmy parents ordered Christmas cards back before I married in l957, so it was only natural that I also ordered my Christmas cards from Miles Kimball....I don\\'t think I\\'ve missed a year that I haven\\'t ordereed something from this company.

Thanks for quick delivery also.\\r\\nPeggy Meuli\\nBetter than expected goose costumes-I bought 3 and they\\'re all good quality, especially the squirrel. \\nThank you!\\nTHis is where we buy ALL of our books!\\nThanks for quick shipping, great product and great service.\\nMy package came super fast and in great condition.

They were bagged, boarded, and packed neatly and safely. They were even labelled and stacked in sequential order! Thanks!\\nAWFUL!!!!!  I will NEVER purchase anything from this store ever again!!!  My husband bought my wedding bands from them and the service is terrible!!!  I took my rings in for a simple cleaning and inspection and once I picked the rings up one of the bands was totally different!!  They destroyed my wedding band!!  They had every excuse but a good one and just acted like it was not a big deal nor should it be a big deal to me!!  HELLOOOO!!  That is my wedding band!!!  I trusted them to take excellent care of my rings and this is what they did not do!!  Thank God my husband purchased my engagement ring from a different store whom we can trust!!\\nYour samples are very very expensive compared to Splice.\\nDisappointing! \\nI ordered a 40th Wedding Anniversary present for my parents and paid for the fast track delivery. My statues said it had been shipped on November 21st but by December 1st it had still not arrived. I have emailed the costumer center and am still awaiting a response. It is now December 8th and STILL no delivery. As you can imagine, I am very disappointed and have found your services quite frustrating.\\nI like it so far seem\\'s to work\\nI LOVE THIS APP! It\\'s super easy to use and easy to understand all the leasons!! I sugest it for everyone!\\nThis is a really good place to create a pay stub! I just started my job and didn\\'t know what to do to show prove if income for my apartments leasings office. I just input the information step by step and it generated exactly what I needed! It was quick, simple, and at an affordable price. It even let me choose a template to customize the way the data appeared on my document. I recommend this service to anyone in need of a pay stub. Whether it\\'s an under the table paying job or a fairly new start up company, ThePayStubs.com has got you covered!\\nThe process to book a car was fast and straight forward. I have booked here 3 times so far, with 1 cancellation on my behalf.  There was a fee involved but I guess its understandable. Other times the rental was painless and professional.  Hope it continues as it\\'s a one stop shop that does it for me.\\nI bought two keys from my desc. They work like perfectly.

I received my order far sooner than expected in elegant packaging. Overall, from merchandise to delivery, Moda Operandi was perfect.\\nThis is my first order very excited to see the product!!\\nI recently purchased a laptop. This was on Nov 15, 2015. Nov 17 the money came out of my account so on the 20th I checked online since I had not received any email about shipping, only an email confirming the order was received. It said the laptop was delivered to Jefferson, GA. Note I live in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada and the order was placed at TigerDirect.ca. I called and was told that this is standard. It is delivered to Tiger Direct warehouse and then shipped on to the customer and that it would now be routed directly to me and I would receive an email. That was 2 days ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever heard a thing so started sending emails to customer service. Eventually they cancelled the order stating the item was lost between the cross dock. However didn\\'t refund me some $15.62 for shipping and some other laptop charge. Now after another few emails I will receive $13. Then a few more and another $1.46. Finally after sending another email that the missing money they had charged for laptop disposal I will receive another $1.15. So only lost $0.01 and spent time sending 9 emails trying to get a solution to my order. Worst company I have ever dealt with online. I Will never deal with them again, neither will my company nor anyone I can suggest to buy elsewhere. Please do not waste your time shopping here. Customer service is a joke.\\nWe took the bus from RI to NYC.  The bus was waiting for us when we arrived and it appeared new.  It was clean and comfortable.\\r\\nThe drop-off was at 30th and 9th.

We enjoyed this ride and will use this again.\\nThe worker honored my time frame and was very patient with my questions\\nFast delivery and great prices!!\\nReceived the wrong item (labeled wrong on the sleeve) and was promptly credited.\\nI work for a general contractor and we were preparing some marketing materials for an upcoming conference, and knew we needed something to give to potential clients.  We found Flashbay online and contacted them about helping us.  They had several products to choose from, along with assigning Ryan Joyal to help us through this process.  Ryan was great and provided great communication and a quick turn around.  We selected the product, submitted the artwork and what we wanted printed (we went with 16gb jump drives).  Ryan quickly prepared a draft for approval and was able to begin having the order processed.  We started process on a Thursday morning, approval by early afternoon, payment in the afternoon (was real easy to submit payment), and I received the product by Tuesday the following week, which was pretty good in my opinion, especially over a holiday weekend.  This was a fast, easy, and pleasant transaction.  Ryan\\'s communication and support was great.  We will definitely look to Ryan and Flashbay for our future needs.\\r\\nThank you,\\r\\nLeo Hanley\\nbought groupon pass and expected hassle during check out.  but everything was fine..  paid $33 for 5 day pass...\\nThis is the first time I\\'ve used JustFly and I have been pleased so far!

I will absolutely use Flashbay in the future and recommend it!!\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you again and again, we LOVE our custom flashdrives.\\nI have an Oregon sensor and a new Extech sensor from Instrumart side by side. The temperatures register virtually the same, but the Extech humidity gauge is much more sensitive and registers much higher at all times. In response to my earlier review questioning this disparity, I received a prompt personal call from Instrumart. The representative spent considerable time reviewing my queries and was extremely informative about the possible causes of the disparity. This was one of the most positive customer-relations experience I have had.\\nThanks Agoda.. I have got the rooms booked in half the price.\\r\\nGreat... \\r\\nKeep up the Good work\\nI like oldies.com very much.  Your product descriptions are very informative so that I can decide which DVDs I really want from more than just the title.

They give young winemakers a chance to begin their trade without having to be a part of a huge corporation.  The wine is wonderful.  You NEVER have to become an angel (the name that nakedwines gives those of us who contribute monthly), but if you are an angel, you get a significant discount.  Like I said, I love this company and I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with them.\\nVery easy application process and I received my approval within a couple if hours.\\nOrdering my items from the site was fast.

Me, and two of my friends decided to take our daughters to New York for their 16th birthday.  I came upon the New York Pass while Googling things to do in New York.  At first I thought, this is too good to be true, there has to be a catch!  We decided to go for it and we were pleasantly surprised at the ease of use!  We picked up our passes upon arriving in the city and hit the ground running!  THANK YOU for making our visit to New York AMAZING!  I have and will continue to recommend the New York Pass to all of my friends and family!\\nEasy to place order both on the net and on the phone!

I used one of the giftcards immediately for an online order, and it worked fine.  The other one, I printed to take with me to a restaurant that evening.  However, when paying for my dinner, the card didn\\'t work, which was extremely embarrassing!  I will know next time to check the restaurant site to make sure that the card is showing an active balance.  I reported this to Cardpool the next day, and my money was refunded within a few days.\\nI tried to cancel an order and it did not candle it now I have 8 things to send back. Please look into it.

Absolutely no dickin\\' around-- not too many of those annoying ads poppin up in your face, and the color palate is fairly easy on the eyes. You type in your destination city and badah-BING-badah-BOOM! Next thing you know you\\'re on the outside of the plexiglass window of the econolodge check in desk, paying pocket change for a smoking room where later that night you\\'ll find out the real purpose of such thin bath tissue, and you\\'ll start to question whether or not you actually died and went to heaven for real this time. 9.7/10 would use Priceline again.\\nWould highly recommend anyone needing a limo in NYC.\\nwish you would drop the handling fees\\nMobile loans was very easy to use and the money was there very fast\\nI was so pleased with how the Titan Cube came out.

I\\'m very pleased to be a loyal customer of theirs.\\nThe customer service was incredible, I always received prompt responses and helpful answers. The quality of the product is stellar as well, definitly my go to sticker company.\\nWell designed replacement part, should solve a recurring problem.

Never have I been disappointed when making changes or adding new equipment and needed a little insight to ensure quality performance. Yes, you can probably find cheaper products but, if you want quality equipment at a fair price, you can trust Security Camera Warehouse, knowing that the service will be there when you need it. For me, the quality of service far outweighs any savings in cheaper equipment!!\\nI ordered 3-Genie 2 button remote receiver\\'s, they substituted and sent me 3-button receiver\\'s, knowing  that on the three button units that only the right hand button works, the other two do not work with my garage doors. \\r\\nThy then charge me a re-stocking fee to return this wrong merchandise.\\r\\nWon\\'t do business with this company again.......\\nReceived a nonworking vape and customer service has not gotten back to me in a week.\\nI recently had an online consultation with a doctor at HelloMD.

It\\'s great.\\nGreat products and great service\\nLang wall calendars are superior in quality and artwork. Instead of hanging a calendar, you are complementing the artwork already in your home.  \\nWe live on a large lake in northern Minnesota and prefer calendars that blend into our environment, whether the four different seasons, lakes, terrains, plants, etc. or the neighbors we live with (bear, moose, deer, fish,etc).\\nThis was a very meaningful way to memorialize someone who recently died.  The family was deeply touched by the gesture and loved the materials that came with the certificate.  I highly recommend the Star Name registry.\\ncartridges  not recognized any longer.

Not the same quality.\\nMy son and I were traveling to NYC for his 10th birthday and wanted to experience as much of the city as we could in 3 days.  The New York pass allowed us to see everything on our list and save a lot of money doing it.  We were very pleased with the pass.\\nI have used BookRenter a few times, and each time I receive my books much earlier than the estimated delivery date. I will continue to use them!\\nI felt a bit confused when I went to check out. I bought the $25.00 gift cards from Fandango. Instead of breaking them down it looked as though I was getting one gift card for $75.00 vice 3 for $25.00.\\nEverything is there that you need to make an amazing dinner.  It also teaches you to expand your flavor profile.  I have used things together that I would never have thought to use before.  I save the recipe booklet to use another time when I buy the ingredients myself.\\n...................................\\nMy reservation was so easy to do. Very easy to navigate what I wanted to do.\\nThe did not end up buying my book which I understand.  They cannot purchase every textbook sent their way.  But what I am disappointed in is that I have to PAY them to get my book back.  Their policy regarding books not purchased was not easily found.  It should be made clear and easy to find when trying to sell textbooks to them.  Seller beware.\\ngreat place to store belongings\\r\\nexcellent staff helping clients\\nSaatchi knows how to appreciate their customers and provide a personal and safe shopping experience from a great selection of art. Returns and money back worked without problems.\\nI love Thrift Books, as my order list and wish list would show. I love that the books are inexpensive and there is free shipping. As, most books are used and have that used book look but overall, I have never had a bad experience with any of the books. They come to me in a decent or above look. Arrival just depends on where it\\'s being shipped from. Sometimes it can take a little longer but I never needed the books right away.\\nFast delivery - no issues!\\nLove all products I have purchased from Pearl Source.\\nEasy checkout, detailed item information.\\nI love the styles and it was an easy choice.\\nThe quality of the product is super ,  met time frame of work , friendly and respectful customer service, easy to contact and resolved any corrections right away..we will order some of your products one of these days. Thank you so much.\\nGreat products. Great customer service!!!\\nI recently ordered an oak frame and some plexi. I was impressed with the sturdiness of the frame. The plexi comes with a covering on it that protects it while in transit. The packaging is very good, nothing can shift and get damaged. I assembled the painting in the frame with ease. The quality is very good and it came quickly. \\r\\nI had a little trouble with ordering online because I ordered two things that were oversized but they fit in the same package. You pay $15 for oversize, but I was charged $30 because I had two oversized items. I called customer service and they deducted $15 as they realized they could send it in one package. I appreciated the discount in shipping, but would not have gotten it by ordering strictly online.\\nAfter completing the course and two interrractions with customer service, we still don’t have a certificate of completion. Two weeks has gone by and they have still not fixed this issue. Would highly NOT recommend using this product.\\nFor the most part, I love this bank.  Not only does a simple checking account accrue positive interest, you are reimbursed for ATM fees (up to $15 per month I believe...).  I\\'ve even used them internationally, and you are charged a reasonable 1% fee.\\n\\nThere are 2 minor drawbacks.  \\n1. You cannot deposit cash as there are no physical banks to go to.\\n2. Once you run out of the first batch of 50(?) checks they give you, you must purchase more.  This is not included.\\n\\nOverall, I am very happy with this bank.\\nPrice was the same if not better than most other sellers. They shipped my item fast and provided notifications for every step. I will definitely buy from them again.\\nI love this website, easy to use and all; must importantly amazing support!!!\\nGreat options, great prices!\\ngreat stuff, close to terminal, short wait, excellent service\\nGreat stickers, really original and good looking.\\nGreat site for job seeking\\nExcellent service! Have used Xoom for a number years now. Love it!\\nApart from the logo on the long sleeve T shirts, I felt that the shirts were average store bought quality but double if not more in price than comparable shirts on the market.  I realize the logo makes these shirts different but how much markup is needed to sell the product?  I would certainly have second thoughts before making further purchases.\\nThis was a easy way to get what I needed. With a money back guarantee it made it even easier!\\n+  everything as discribed,  100% satisfied\\r\\n\\r\\n- I did not recieve a password after booking, so it was not possible to tell the hotel some special preferences. I had to call the hotel for that, which worked fine.\\nIts easy and convenient, great deals, and support specially for first time flyers. Thanks!\\nGreat value to explore New York city\\nthe experience was excellent. Site was user friendly and easy to use and will be using it for future top ups.\\nTimely shipping. Great customer service when I cancelled and reordered rugs because I decided the first set were going to be the wrong color blue. Love the rug I did order. Color is perfect.  The wool nap is thick and dense. Great quality for the money.  It is shedding badly with vacuuming. Hope it stops soon.\\nEasy to use great price,fast response\\'\\nQuick and simple!!!\\nVery happy with everything. I order from you for our event Reality Rally so thousands of people see your product so it has to be good and reflect our image. Thank you\\nServiz was very responsive to my request for a quote, made themselves available on short notice. They booked the job on the best day for me.  The floors have never looked better, Andrew did a great job.\\nI have booked two flights from JustFly and they have always given me the best deal. While it takes some carefully detailed reading, but if done right, you will have a really successful flight. I have had no troubles whatsoever on my bookings or my flight communication.\\nUnfortunately I had to use the services of a travel insurance company on my trip to Europe a few months ago.  Fortunately Allianz Global Assistance was amazing!!!  Their agents are experienced and extremely helpful.  My claim was handled and resolved quickly and paid within 2 weeks.  Will use Allianz for all my travel needs in the future.\\nWe are pleased to say that, your server has been outstanding, 100% UP i.e. highly availabile, fault tolerant, has fulfilled all our needs till date and has given good response to webpage loading. Moreover, you and your team have been best in customer support..\\nI am satisfied\\nSo easy, worked great! Thank you, i can now play monster hunter on my switch!\\nExcellent service in all aspects ie service, safe travel, and comfortable.\\nThanks.\\nV.S.Ramasubban.\\nHappy I found OptiContacts.com.  I ordered AirOptix Contact Lenses.  OptiContacts.com sells them at a very reasonable price, half the price in fact, and quick ships them very quickly.\\nThe customer service representative was very helpful, polite, and patient.\\nI would highly recommend this website. I rented my calculus book for the semester for $170 less than the rental price at my college bookstore. The delivery was fast. I got my book within 1 week of ordering it. Overall this website is perfect. I wish they had more books though because I would definitely purchase or rent them all from here.\\nThey make everything to order which takes some time. Customer Service is non-existent if you call they don\\'t answer, if you email they won\\'t respond. They need to pull some of that marketing money and put it towards customer service. Overall the product shipped and was good quality so alas, three stars.\\nI have never heard of JustFly before, so I was really surprised at how easy the website would use. I would definitely recommend to friends.\\nNo issues at all.\\nI have an account that we use specifically for our high school class reunion expenses.  I had checks made with our school mascot and logo on them and they are perfect!\\nI can\\'t work it out, I must be to old, simple is the key!!\\nLeslie Davis eliminated all of our worries surrounding the topic of \"early retirement\", especially at a younger than expected age.  We\\'re no longer concerned with outliving our money, and will leave a substantial nest egg to our children.\\nDefinitely recommend! Very fast shipping, along with tracking your package. I did have an issue with my antenna, but they responded back very quickly so we could discuss the issue at hand. I sent pics along with our emails so they could see the issue as well. I am an extremely satisfied customer! You can\\'t just walk into a store anymore and purchase a steel whip, they have to be ordered online. Grateful I found a company that takes care of the customers\\nI was excited to receive my parcel, and it arrived punctually. The peace I had that first night was so welcome! And it got me into the habit of sleep, which has since meant I don\\'t always have to use them- but I take them everywhere just in case! So sleeplessness is not a common event now in my life.\\nMy experience has been great!\\nI love thrift books!!! I\\'ve ordered many and many books from them and I\\'ve always been happy with my orders!! I always tell people about this site!!! 🤘😻🤘😻🤘\\nThe one and only - great interface, great service , fair security , lots of options - the king of social networks !\\nwould definetely recommend to others! VERY satisfied!\\nmade a booking in prag via Amoma. Everything perfect. Tkx\\nIts a great product, and even better company to deal with. They were very thorough in teaching us how to work with out dogs. the installation was easy as well.\\nI didn’t think drivers ed could be fun until I learned from ace thanks for the information and tips. I recommend this to anyone trying to get behind the wheel !\\nMy experience was A+\\nWe thought we were had to put our cat Solomon down because of a urinary problem he had which was chronic.  UTI save his life and our hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you\\nI received my card quickly. I have not use it yet, but I am excited about using it soon.\\nEvery purchase adiquirido I have more confidence to buy more and am sure it will arrive. \\r\\nThanks for giving me that feeling\\nThis is my second time ordering contacts and they still have not arrived (the order was placed 13 days ago). There is no notice saying they have shipped yet so it will likely be several more days still before they arrive.  I\\'ve received two requests to submit a review and plan to make a phone call tomorrow to see what the problem is. The previous order took a long time and I had to call to ask them to call the doctor again since they said he had not approved the prescription yet. The prescription should still be valid as my last visit was less than a year ago and I just requested a refill. Probably won\\'t order online again when I can just go order them from the doctor and it takes less time\\nFast shipping and friendly customer service when I called to inquire about my order.  In regards to the sink protectors sitting too high off the bottom of the sink I took the rubber plastic feet off and they sat in the sink with just enough clearance to make it easy to rinse the sink of food waste and fits my sinks perfectly.  Without the rubber feet in place the metal leaves a sort of dark mark on the stainless but you can\\'t see it with the protector in place and the mark can be removed with a little Bar Keeper\\'s Friend if you end up removing the protector.  I wish I had bought these sooner!  It was a great purchase!\\nI did plenty of research before I decided to purchase a bridal set from PrimeStyle. In fact there was a moment when I wasn\\'t so sure I wanted to go through with it. You read the positive and negative reviews and it\\'s up to you to test your luck so to speak. I finally decided to take a chance and the worst case scenario based on a negative review I read is that it would take awhile to receive my refund.When i received my rings I couldn\\'t believe it. I immediately knew that I found a place that I will purchase my jewelry from for life. The ring is absolutely stunning. When I proposed she cried and cried and spent the rest of the night staring at her finger. I can\\'t even count the number of compliments we have received. I still look at it with amazement. If you\\'re reading my review it\\'s true. I have not been paid to make this up. That was an issue I had during my research phase because I wasn\\'t sure who was behind the typing. I will NEVER shop anywhere else they officially have my business for life. Thank you PrimeStyle!\\nWestern Union is a trust worthy and reliable. It is quick and their transfer rates are better and competitive compared to others in the market. Highly recommended 👍\\nThe website was very easy to navigate. I bought two Littmann classic III stethoscopes, one for my wife and one for myself. One was the black tubing with black bell and the other was the raspberry tubing with rainbow bell. I had them both laser engraved too. I took about 5-6 days from order placement to arrival at my house. The quality of the stethoscopes are amazing. I can hear so much better and pick up subtle changes that I couldn\\'t hear in my old off brand stethoscope. Medisave kept me updated every step of the way from order placement ti shipping. I feel the price of the stethoscopes, the engraving, and the shipping were very competitive.  Everything went as expected. I do like how the took the extra step to require signature for USPS to deliver at my house, but I wish it was more clear up front that a signature was required. I have a delivery lock box on my porch but USPS didn\\'t leave it and I had to go down and pick it up. Otherwise it was a great experience. I would definitely buy from medisave again in the future should I need to buy another stethoscope.\\nThe employee was professional, on time & courteous.  Connie L.\\nThe staff was extremely friendly and I felt very welcome from the moment I stepped in until I left. I am satisfied with their service and of course, will be coming back. Thank you, LaserAway!\\nNice website....great assortment of products...fast delivery.\\nVery Good Company :-)\\nI\\'m so glad I ended up getting 10 Pod 10 Strip XKchrome App Control Motorcycle Advanced LED Accent Light Kit. Super easy to install and to play with. Service is the Best. My package has been stolen while it was waiting for me by the front door. I called XKglow service and they were super cool and helpful. They sent me another one with out any quastion asked. Thank you\\nI am not quick to trust anyone and after talking to Raphael for about five minutes, I felt like he cared about helping me clear my credit.  Having someone in your corner you feel that you can trust can help in the decision making process, and allows you to breathe a sigh relief.  I think Raphael needs a raise because I am a tough cookie, and I look for the negative before I can see the positive.  Thank you Raphael, your assistance really meant a lot to me.\\nSeamless, flawless and timely.. My clubs arrived in Florida two days early... Price to ship 1500 miles was excellent. .\\nI found Thrift Books when looking for a particular book. Now I always check Thrift Books before I buy a new or old book. Their network of member bookstores is huge, so it\\'s likely that I will find most of the books I am looking to read at bargain prices. No complaints. Nothing but accolades.\\nThank you for the quick shipping your customer is always fantastic and your products are excellent.\\nFabletics is the best!!\\nAt first I was disappointed. \\r\\nThe image was pretty pixilated and the curtain itself was very thin. \\r\\nI almost returned the curtain but after I put it up, it grew on me. \\r\\nFor the price ($50+) paid it should have been much better quality!\\nI love the service!  Searching for the book value and setting up the sell back were smooth transactions.  There was a hitch with one of my books and they got in contact with me right away to ask me what I wanted to do about it, so communication is great, too!  And the money came, just as expected!  The only thing I would improve (if it\\'s possible?...) is the book that had a hitch - on the website it passed the appraisal stage but when I sent it in I was informed that it was not an acceptable book - apparently it was a teacher\\'s edition, but it wasn\\'t apparent to me when I owned it.  So, it would have been better if in the appraisal stage the isbn would have revealed this fact about my book, rather than me proceeding with sending it in (because it was \"acceptable\") and anticipating money for it.\\nI\\'ve dealt with other buyers of books, but, I prefer Sell Back Your Books, because they are hassle-free.\\nThe watch they sent me was not even posted to there web page\\nCompany was able to modify the artwork with a quick response.  Product is great.\\nHello. I found your site purely by accident. I was actually looking for a watch for someone else and next thing I knew I started seeing watches I was interested in. What a vast selection of men\\'s watches . I\\'ll be back. Thanks\\nSales Associate Robin did the best she could do to get me in the vehicle that I wanted and in a timely manor. She was awesome\\nSimple:  competitive pricing, simple buying process, incredibly speedy delivery.  Great experience\\nThey we\\'re here did the work and got it done.  No issues. Thanks\\nPick up at the hotel delated\\nBoy guide not business like,  talking about himself and not about San Francisco\\'s history \\nOnly Alcatraz was interesting\\nHad problems with my order so I called costumer service. Talked with them and problem was solved quickly. Very good costumer service! Thank you!!\\nAsked for the unlock for an iPhone 5s late on Friday afternoon, unlock completed by Wednesday afternoon. No hassle, communications and updates were good, can\\'t complain! Price was reasonable as well. Well done! Would definitely recommend this service to anyone.\\nAMAZING LOVE MY NECKLACE 😀😀\\nCardpool was taken over by another company last year. The formerly stellar customer service is now garbage. The selection of cards available is greatly reduced. The discounts are smaller. And, you can no longer see your Wishlist (now called Favorites) all in one place. You have to go through card by card by card to find out if you\\'ve added a card to your Favorites.  The website is also much harder to navigate since they \"improved\" it.\\nShipping was quick and by UPS. A ground shipment option should be offered via U S mail. U. S. Mail much preferred over all others. Package was accurate and well packaged.\\npicked up the car from nice airport on the 27th dec from a very poorly lite garage. the light was so bad the girl had a torch for us to inspect the car.\\nwe had to point out several markes on the car to her, all she kept saying was that will be ok don\\'t worry. basically she couldn\\'t care less. NOW on our return to a garage with flood lights and a girl who is going over it with a fine touth comb even on her knees under the car surprise she finds a mark under the car. this was not done by us  this is a scam by the company to fleece motorists off their money. they deducted 1100 euros from my card . and when the repair cost is taken from it they will reimburse the rest. luckeIy i purchased extra insurance in the uk .DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY\\nPurchase to delivery went smooth\\nVery good to work with\\nJackThreads has a great collection and I got a pair of Levis from them. It was well under the original price. Only problem is that it took about a week longer than I had expected. Great overall experience though.\\nThe surveys are usually pretty short and not that difficult to get through. The only problem that I have is that the system will not allow me to take most surveys due to the line of work I\\'m in. For these surveys I am given 2-3 points so it takes a long time to get to the $10 limit you need to redeem\\nDresses,didnt fit and material was not up to standard.\\nno more worries about broken shafts, lost luggage. seamless shipping/tracking of your clubs. travel carry- on and feel the freedom!\\nThanks you to Ranjit (ranjitATflyopediaDOTcom) for his help getting me ticket.\\nAs we have been doing for over 20 years... making our trek from New England to Aspen CO. Our agent we\\'ve been using for all those years is Sara Thomas. She always goes above and beyond to make the entire trip painless in planning, great accommodation recommendations, lift ticket deals and perfect Colorado weather and snow!\\nFor my first purchase the order was reviewed quickly!! Would recommend!!\\nEasy and simple reservation.\\nchanged typo in address immediately.\\nI\\'ve purchased a couple of watches from Jomashop. Both instances featured FAST shipping (as in receiving the products within 2 days), well packaged products, with expected touchpoints (email receipts, when it shipped, tracking, etc). I wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy from them again.\\nI had a number of problems with the website.  There was no mention of the $25.00 charge for selecting a seat - then I was unable to void the seat selection.  Also, the website is too slow - by the time a person is able to complete all of the information and make the choices, the seat(s) were sold out.  Not a good experience.  However, I spoke to Cedric in customer service and that was excellent.  He was able to take care of the transaction quickly.  He was friendly, efficient and professional.  Good Job!\\nThere are so many horror stories about travelling with Ryanair, but my experience last week was an excellent one.  Check-in was fine, the flight was great with vg service, pick up at other end all straightforward.  Both outward and return flights were on time.  Staff very pleasant at all points.  What\\'s not to like?!\\nThe only reason it is not a 5 star is because it has not yet funded. Will know more at that time.\\nI’m happy that I am on my way to a life free of debt.\\nI placed other frame and I got the other that to bent for one side!!!\\nI chose Bookrenter over the competition even though it was a couple dollars more expensive. Their standard/free shipping could guarantee that I would get my book the following week, whereas other \"cheaper\" options could take up to 14 business day unless I paid a ton in extra shipping rates. My book arrived in quickly and in excellent condition. I haven\\'t gone through the return process yet, but I imagine there will be no issue. I have already recommended Bookrenter to 2 of my classmates.\\nBooks were cheap, came quickly and in great condition.

Comfortable, attractive and most importantly GREAT sun protection!  We definitely will be returning customers!\\nI went in to get a hole plugged in my tire.  Upon review my tire was very worn and they felt I needed to replace it with a new tire.  Really wanted me to buy 2 tires, both fronts were bad.  I, financially, went in to plug a hole, and didn\\'t expect to walk out paying $107.00 for a tire, just one, I could not afford to buy 2.  That was not good, but the service was beyond excellent.  They took me in right away and took care of me with amazing care.  Thank you Town Fair Tire.\\nAwesome service, had the part in a couple of days.\\nThe recipes are great!

I sent my order 2 days ago, received a confirmation quickly, but the rather small order has not shipped yet.\\nhad a very personable representative who was very helpful.\\nI would like my money refunded or another one shipped\\nFiled a claim for my Galaxy 5 repair and claim was quickly approved. Shipping label was sent and I returned it immediately. They promise quick turn around but after 3 days I called to check. They later did acknowledge receipt and advised that the repair was being done. Just a few hours later they advised the repair was finished and overnight shipment was done. (Amazing )  By the promised time I received the package from FEDEX and opened it to find 1/2 a phone. No back, battery, SIM card , or micro SD. What? How can this happen?? They did respond to the service contractor and eventually ( 2 weeks later) I received a new back &  battery. After I complained, I finally received a micro sd. Not wanting to wait this long, this all happened after I bought all the  replacement parts. So, they did eventually come through, but much too late. Not to mention that I did lose all my data from the original sd micro. \\nI thought it only fair that my $50 deductible was refunded but they have not done that. I ended up paying a total of $180 to have a working phone and know the repair facility close to me would have made the repair in an hour for the same price. Do you have to ask \"why all the communication, waiting, etc. for no value?\\nI was skeptical at first with their great prices, but yes its true. Definitely a good experience. No hidden agenda. I will be using them again.\\r\\nThank you Bookbyte!\\nGreat people who have been working there for years.

Great looking store to and well staffed to help everyone even though it was busy. Look forward to continuing to shop with these folks in the future.\\nI\\'ve been using Home Advisor for a while.  the contractors are a mixed back or have mixed performance.  I\\'ve gained 2 reliable contractors.  I\\'ve also had contractors start the job to find they don\\'t have the experience, bail the project for other jobs, be rude, leave the job unfinished.\\n  \\nAs a Business Analyst/Project Manager It would be good if Home Advisor could either provide an optional project management or tracking service or open the door to project managers to offer their services as an addition to projects.  A third party establishing the needs and performance and end result of the job could be helpful and establishing better contractor motivation, reliability and quality.\\nI wont exaggerate but Trustpilot is very trustworthy. \\r\\nI guess this is the best place if you want legit reviews coming from legit customers because Trustpilot takes a lot of consideration before approving your review.\\r\\n\\r\\nThumbs up to Trustpilot. Please continue the goodness that you are doing :)\\nDear Javier,\\n\\nThis was one of the best experiences I have had in dealing with insurance. I have been without health insurance for about a year. While trying to acquire insurance myself I had difficulty navigating the different care options in addition to thinking I would be unable to attain insurance until the open enrollment period in November. Javier you were very professional, and took out the guess work in determining what amount of coverage I needed that was within my budget. \\n\\nI hope all the employees at goHealth are as exemplary and helpful as you Javier. I no longer have to worry about my future healthcare needs thanks to you.

I did some shopping on my own, then I heard the Select Quote commercial on Sunday morning. I logged in, entered some basic info, and the next day David Trevino called. We had much in common despite the difference in age, and he gave me the numbers. I tried to find a better deal for each of us, but I could not! I called him back, we did the deal and it was exactly as advertised. We are very pleased, and I am very happy that David is my agent! Thank you David, and thank you Select Quote!!\\nPrius is awesome!! He’s professional, friendly, and accommodating. He is prompt with our questions and concerns.

I originally ordered HD DVR and did not recieve it, I was charged much more than I expected and once I tried calling back I was informed about checking recordings and I was on hold for about 10 min. I am very close to canceling my account when I just got it....SMDH. Not good not good at all.\\nI ordered some custom journals to be given out during an awards ceremony. My order was supposed to arrive three weeks before the ceremony. A week after the expected arrival date, I logged in to CafePress to see why they hadn\\'t come, and my order showed as cancelled. I didn\\'t get any kind of notification from CafePress that my order had been cancelled.\\n\\nI called CafePress customer service to find out what was up, and I was told the the order had been cancelled because of a suspected copyright violation. I used our organization\\'s logo on the journals, so fair enough, I don\\'t blame them for flagging it. But to not notify me was totally unacceptable.\\n\\nThe customer service representative I spoke to was very pleasant, but she could not do anything to reinstate my order. She said she would put in a ticket to some other group that could and told me they would call me within 24 hours. 24 hours later, no call, so I called back. Spoke to the exact same very nice CSR, who gave me a phone number for this mysterious other group. Called the number, it went straight to voicemail. Left a message with my phone and email. Next day, still no call back. Called again, straight to voicemail again, left another message. No response. \\n\\nSo, totally fed up, I went and ordered the exact same type of journal from Vistaprint, which turned out to be a lot cheaper, even with the expedited shipping I had to pay for in order to get the journals before the ceremony. \\n\\nI will never use CafePress again.\\nGot the key almost instantly, redeemed without problem on Steam.\\nNice hotel,  good location in Soho,  near subway,   reasonable price,  kind staff.

The checkout was very easy without any difficulties and also my shipping was very fast so I would recommend no questions asked\\nI decided to go with Quicken Loans for my latest home loan and glad I did.  There were 3 people that made it all happen: one that started me off with the credit checks and pre-approval.  Then another to help my loan get expedited.  And then finally one to help me close.  At first it sounds like there is potential for a lot of miscommunication but not at all!  Each person was easily accessible.  I would definitely use them again.\\nOrdered before and their shipping time frame has steadily increased.  This time they \"lost\" the order and we had to call and find out where it was.  There customer service team saved it by getting us everything by Monday, but my cat was without a med for 4 days because of the \"lost order\" and we ordered a full week before we ran out.\\nThe driver arrived twenty minutes late. The car service called me 10 minutes before pick up & said they were running 10 minutes behind. He did not have the AC running when he arrived and it was Monday when the heatwave was going on.

Douglass has been available to help with questions or concerns that I have had over the years regarding our family trust and business interest.\\nLike many stated is true. This is the worst travel agency I\\'d ever encountered. It takes them forever to process your flight ticket, you have to constantly call them to make sure you receive your email ticket in your email.  Make sure you read your flying dates accurate if you get a good deal. Please be sure to take a picture of the flight you are reserving from the website and call the agent that is the flight/price you want, because they will try to make an excuse like: please hold 2 minutes, (these minutes are to remove the deal you found in the website) by the time the travel agents comes back he/she will tell you they don\\'t have it available.\\nThis is my first time having this extremely bad experience from a travel agency.

Served up with an awful taste of customer service! I purchased the Shelby sofa and matching chair. In addition, I spent an additional $3500 on other furniture.  In May 2018, I submitted a claim for a ripped cushion on the sofa. I was notified it was a week past the manufacturer’s warranty.  In good faith, HZ Waco (Sean) ordered a replacement cushion. Now three more tears appear on the other two cushions.  HZ refuses to replace defective merchandise.  I have many pictures of the tops in sofa.

He made sure, all my issues were resolved without giving me any hard time. What really surprised me is that he followed up with me to re-confirm that i no longer had any other issues.  , He understood my frustration and made sure they all are resolved.  I am very pleased with dealing with him and I would surely recommend his name to other customers especially if they had any issues... Fernando Reyes deserves the 5 star I rate.\\nWell worth it!\\nThe books are less expensive but still in very good condition (I purchased under very good condition) and they arrive in a timely manner. I only waited about a week.\\nItem was too expensive for the quality\\nI was very pleased by the professionalism and knowledgeable service I received from Maliah.  She was prompt, very polite and had a good sense of what I was looking to spend and wanted from my trip.   She would respond to questions immediately and based on this I started telling all my friends about Apple and their service teams efforts.\\nsome of the merchandise lasted to the first wash then it just fell apart.  The only thing i love about fabletics are the leggings.\\nWhen I called CHW for a problem with my water heater they responded quickly and the service provider was here the same day.  Unfortunately the fix didn\\'t last, but CHW again responded quickly and the same company arrived the next day and all seems well now.  As I would expect, I only paid the $45 service fee once since the first time did not fix the problem.\\nI wanted to buy a particular model(RX5228) of Ray-Ban eyeglasses, which I couldn\\'t find anywhere in my hometown so I thought of ordering it on Lenskart based on trust and their reputation. But the problem was that I had no idea on how to enter the power details, so I went to the store to order them.The representative at the store assured me that the glasses were under \"14 days no questions asked return promise\"(WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SCAM) and I\\'d be given a refund as I had not seen the glasses physically and that I had no idea that it would fit my face. Then the glasses were delivered and found that the print in the temples were of inferior quality and would fade away in time and would like the same model in pure black colour. And now I call the store, and they tell me that they accept returns(how the hell am I supposed to know if the glasses look good on me without trying it?) only for their in-house brands(Vincent chase and John Jacobs). I\\'ve called the customer care and they\\'re just stalling for time so that the 14 day period ends and they can just shrug it off! Worst experience and waste of Rs 6700/-. Would never buy from Lenskart again and recommend you not to throw your hard earned money down the drain. I\\'ve still got the ticket details if you doubt me.\\n\\nLENSKART DOWN DOWN!!\\n\\nEdit 1: Date: 24/10/2017\\nThe store accepted the return(Order no:1212966821) and selected another pair of glasses for which I haven\\'t yet received the order confirmation in my mail, by then I\\'ll post the new order number.

What I didn\\'t realize was that asking for estimate meant the three would call immediately. I contracted with the first call as his quote was below the average estimates you posted.

I contacted them more than 10 times and they always pass the buck to another department or manager but will bot give anyone\\'s name to contact. Lots of computer generated replies and run-around. Shady practices to say the least. Still waiting for wrong part pick up and refund 40+ days later.

We were told the vehicle was out for repair but assured that one would be available upon our return trip. It was not. The experience was terrible for my 90 year old mother, who was lifted onto the vehicle by myself and other kindhearted passengers.\\nNever will I use Amazon again! I had a local bookstore tell me about this website when I couldn\\'t find books in their used section.

That surely is an added bonus.\\r\\n If i could change anything, it would be the fact that I have tried and used so many of his products that I can never remember what product I have written a review on. So I always have a hassle trying to get my discount code.\\r\\n If my opinion matters, try to incorporate a link that customers can click to list the products they have written reviews on. \\r\\nThanks Dherbs for all that you do. I am a loyal customers, and I have been for several years.\\nIt was all done very well and arrived on time.\\nI kept trying to stress that I would have a handicap man with me and I needed a rm as close to the elevator as possible I needed a refridgerator and he said he would have one sent to the rm.It seemed a little rushed so I will be very surprised if my and my husbands stay will meet his needs.He said there were only 4 rms left and if I booked now he woyld give me a discount,,seemed liked he was more interested in me booking than our needs.\\nThe overall experience was quite good.  Check in was easy and efficient.  When I arrived back in Newark, I was picked up immediately and my vehicle was ready with the trunk open for my luggage.  My only complaint was that I had paid the $30 + fees for the premium car wash wash, and that was terrible if done at all.  The car was dirty and windows poorly cleaned.  So, next time I don\\'t get that.  Otherwise, a good place to park.\\nAll the items ordered arrived in good condition and did not take long.\\nAT this time cannot rate as UPS has lost order\\nI recently ordered snow shoes and I am happy to say that the order was delivered on time with no issues.

No squeak and performance feels good. Ordering the rear brakes soon.\\nBest prices, fast shipping and quality products\\nEasy to use, very convenient dash board. Like the product.\\nWrote to you on a Monday to get a shirt and 26.2 magnets for my wife before the weekend.  Paid extra for expedited shipping. Come Friday, I had no shipment, and her race was on Sunday, I had NO gifts to celebrate her first marathon.  When I wrote to complain on Monday, your service reps make reference as if I might still receive my first shipment, when your tracking information shows it was NEVER even picked up.  And NO, u didn\\'t even reimburse the cost of expedited shipping!\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW: ordered a shirt and magnets from your competition that Friday for a co-worker, and had it the following Monday.  Didn\\'t pay any extra for shipping.  In case you can\\'t decipher that, YOU Suck!\\nTake care of this company! Wizz Air has evidently as business concept to charge exorbitant fees. I passed together with 30 other passengers in their luggage trap which consists of special luggage rules. All of the companies I have flown with allows a cabin suitcase 55x40x20 cm. and a small shoulder bag.  Wizz-Air just allows a cabin suitcase 42x32x25 cm and zero handbag. Me and my wife had 2 suitcases 50x38x20 and each a small shoulder bag with camera, toilet kit, book and newspaper for the trip. Because our cabin suitcases was too big we had to pay extra. But because we had the small shoulderbag we had two pieces of luggage, when only one was allowed. And we had to pay for that too. This cost us 260 Euro while plane tickets cost 22 Euro. When something is too cheap to b true – it is normally not true. This was no exeption.\\nI feel grossly cheated. So beware of their baggage rules and never change your ticket.\\nExcellent service and products!\\nI\\'ve used Bull guard now for about 3 years and have had no problems with it and they give you free upgrades \\nM Brooks\\nEfficient but I find all the different names puzzling (e.g. Autoreisen, Top Car, Rentalcars)\\nworth each penny\\nOwner answered our questions in a timely manner\\nThe only issue I have is their stickers tear the covers of my books.

Good product.\\nI would highly recommend Plaque Maker for your next project.  Not only did they provide excellent service they were willing to custom order a special glass size for me even though it was not part of their stock sizes.  They even took that a step further by ordering (at their cost) 2 extra pieces of the special glass stock.  The reason I know this is that I had to order, as it turns out, 2 extra pieces 1 week prior to my grand opening and they delivered on time.  Ordering \"special stock\" at that late date would have resulted in not receiving my plaques on time.  Plaque Maker delivered and saved the DAY!\\r\\nA special note of thanks to Aubry who was a joy and delight to work with at Plaque Makers.\\nSometimes only saves a few dollars sometimes none should have extra site for members of armed forces to enter dod # sadly whether an extra 5% or 2% or free upgrade to better airline seats something these men and woman deserve something they pay the ultimate sacrifice if I find another site like Priceline who does this unfortunately I will switch\\nGot a good deal when needed it.\\nMy cyclone rake has worked great. The only negative aspect has come from my mower pulling the product.  Having a zero turn mower, it tends to be light in front and when I get a heavy load sometimes it will want to rare up going uphill.  Also it\\'s rough on the drive belt pulling a heavy load and wears them out faster.\\nColin Buley was great. Was able to find me a close install date at a much less cost to install than other companies. Would highly suggest giving Colin a call when you need anything done.\\nGREAT pc games store, GREAT deal and GREAT buying experince. I like this site.\\nGreat glasses but they said 3-5 days.

Gigmasters provided me with a list of qualified providers, and they provided other related services suggestions.\\r\\nI was able to read all the reviews on the provider, and I picked one who provided an exceptional service.\\r\\nTotally satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you\\nMost all of my books were in good to excellent condition.  Some were used well and others not and that was acceptable to me.  What is not acceptable is when I get a book that says \"good\" when purchased and pages are falling out and one page is missing from the end of the book.  It\\'s disappointing.  Thankfully it was only $3.59, but I\\'ll probably need to buy it again.\\nYou should have a coupon code of a 3% discount for ALLKEYSHOP like a lot of others do. That\\'s how I found you. Pricing is good , could be just a tad bit lower on some games. But I\\'m really satisfied with your services overall.\\nI ordered a painting when it was 45% off and the site said \"sale ends tomorrow.\"  Then it was pushed to 50% off the next day.  They were nice enough to give me the extra 5% when I emailed but then I noticed it moved to 55% the next day.  I was a little frustrated but didn\\'t feel like following up again.  I wrote a somewhat negative review on here and they immediately emailed me to resolve the problem.  They ended up giving me the extra 5% off.  I wish more companies acted this quickly and appropriately.\\nOur expectations have been met by booking thru priceline.\\nYou stock everything I need, I get my orders in two days. Online ordering is easy. Sturdy shipping boxes. On a personal note, I was born in S.F. but live in Reno now. Thank you, The Lavender Guy\\nNothing wrong happened. Paid a good price and got a lot of games.\\nThe product I wanted was not available although the website allowed me to put it into the cart.  Eventually I purchased another product which is satisfactory.  It arrived as promised.  Your shipping costs are ridiculously high.  Then, after I ordered, you sent an offer of a price reduction and free shipping which would have reduced my overall cost by about 50%.  Overall cost of $26 for a calendar is exorbitant.  I will not be buying from you again.\\nAN TRUSTHY COMPANY EVER\\nThis site lives up to its name; the books I purchased were in fantastic shape and were sent pronto.  I am very impressed with this site and will continue to shop here.  Thanks for a fabulous 1st but not last experience!\\nLOVE it how it showed me the videos it was fun it\\'s worth it studying with this app, I\\'m so satisfied. It\\'s just perfect.\\nTwice I have placed orders for gifts for my wife. Both times the clothing in the orders was shipped at different times. No big deal. But, both times I received emails stating one item had shipped and 8-10 days later a different item arrived without any notice. Most recently I  ordered two pairs of pants and some boots. Three weeks ago I got an email stating one pair of pants was shipped and the other ones and boots would d ship later. Two weeks ago got an email saying boots had shipped but it could take 8 working days to arrive. 10 working days later, no boots, but the other pants arrived, again without notice\\nI ordered $100 plus in candy never received it Bern fighting with candy warehouse for a refund\\nAs always fast processing and shipping,  great pice, great product. I love Mr.Suppz\\nHighly recommended Foodler! It\\'s a great way to find good food in a new place and it\\'s so convenient. Way better than calling to order and having to give your payment info and address every time!! Plus, Foodler has some of the best customer service around. I made the mistake of ordering Chinese from a place in Boston and when I told Foodler the food was inedible they credited my account $25. Really can\\'t think of anything bad to say about them!\\nAs the main employee user at Baked N Sconed I would highly recommend FiveStars to any business. I enjoy having the ability of the dashboard and seeing how many people we reach and how successful (or not) our promotions are. Our customers truly love it because they can earn rewards while we love it because it brings those customers in. We have the freedom to choose what we want to market and when. The truly only downfall is that we have chosen to not link it with our POS system because of compatibility reasons, but that really doesn’t effect our usage of the system. I love being a FiveStars business member and also using it as a customer!\\nVery good service and fast answer for my tickets\\nGreat price & user friendly access\\nHi, it took a while for the leaves to fall, but used it yesterday.

The agent was professional, knowledgeable, and respectful in tone and answers to my questions.\\nMy custom tees came quickly, on time & look great.

It was one of the easiest experiences ever.\\nTrue to internet form, this company wants to cut costs by having a robot take your order and then asking 50 questions to hopefully get you to upgrade what seems to be a good deal.  Robot got my order dead WRONG, then it took 4 phone calls to get it corrected.  We will see results after billing and receipt of goods.\\nOutstanding.\\nNeed:\\n1.

What I have a problem with is I\\'m STARVING all the time.  Even sticking to the suggested snack list I can\\'t beat the hunger.  I can actually feel a change in my clothing, however I haven\\'t lost any \"weight\".  Even the price of the items works out; I end up saving money bec I\\'m not spending $6 a day on fast food.

Sure enough. One of the last two units of the size we wanted in that storage location was being rented right before we got there. The staff member at that storage was also super friendly, super kind, and very customer service oriented. We got the last one available for that location and the whole process took about 10 minutes.

Not only is the candy ultra delicious,  but alot of the candies you wouldn\\'t ordinarily be able to obtain at your local stores.  Originally I purchased my husband a 3 mo gift subscription as an Anniversary gift.  It wasn\\'t  long before we BOTH were anxiously awaiting the delivery day.  We\\'d track the pkg together,  text each other photos once the box arrived, send video Snapchats of the unveiling of the new candies we had & of course,  enjoyed tasting/eating the yummy candy.  Sadly, the 3 mo gift subscription came to an end.  Without any hesitation,  we elected to sign up for the 1yr subscription & up the # of candies we were to recieve monthly.  Now,  what once was a shared photo of the box on our doorstep, has turned into nothing short of a small Candy Club monthly documentary. Food for our marraige,  LOL. \\nI will say,  1 time we did have an issue arise (this was before they offered customers to pick thier own candy) , we recieved 2 of the same type of candy 2 months in a row.  I called to just inquire & the lady I spoke to, without ANY hesitation,  stated they were sending out a new box of candy immediately as a replacement.  They were very concerned with our satisfaction & by far made up for the error. \\nI HIGHLY recommended The Candy Club to everyone.  You never know.... it may just strenghten your marraige ❤\\nI’ve bought three Gaggia machines from WholeLatteLove now, given two as Christmas presents, all three of us love our Gaggia Coffee machines, they make excellent and perfect cups of coffee and more.\\nAll the items I ordered for friends and family for Christmas was wonderful....everyone said they were delicious.\\nExcellent Service\\nAll aspects of the financing process of our solar system has gone through smoothly.

Amazing quality for the price. The sizing was accurate as well. I have never written a review before but I thought this was necessary because I saw a lot of negative reviews about sizing and I wanted to clarify that if you know your measurements it is ACCURATE! Will definitely be shopping here again and again! \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks!!\\nIt was hard for my wife to get the car out\\nI looked up my part I needed for my truck.   Easily ordered it and it came in less time then was estimated.  My mirror was exactly like my other one and installation was easy. Great company will use again if I need truck parts. And the price was less then anyone.\\nEvery supplement I have ordered (several different ones) has been top quality and delivered as expected.

None of the large stores carried the German cabinet hinge I needed to replace.  My excellent rep Jason, who assisted me through the process, was able to identify the needed part with the pictures I sent him.  He also sent me instructions on how to take the measurements so that the part would be the exact size needed.  The price was very reasonable and the delivery was super fast.

I have had 2 occasions to call XE with a question and each time I got through in just a few seconds and in both cases my questions were answered by knowledgable and competent people.\\nWe recently transferred about 3500 dollars US from our Canadian bank account. No fees and the difference between that transaction and what we would have received at our \"big six\" was $80 in our favour. We use the CSA currency exchange as well for monthly transfers but for ad hoc requirements and for our RBC US dollar visa payment this is ideal.\\nOnce the XE account is established with links to the bank accounts used, the process is flawless and efficient. Highly recommended!\\nVery courteous and prompt.\\nThe ladies were very pleasant and helpful. Very good customer service. Took the time to explain everything and answer my questions and concerns. They weren\\'t trying to rush me out.\\nI chose Veterans United for a no money down VA Loan and they did a fantastic job from start to finish.  My loan officer, Daniel Heggarty, walked us through the process from pre-qualification, approval to closing.  They helped me find an agent and made sure the process was kept moving along.  When we started having delays with the listing agent, he got on it with both the listing and our agent to get things done.  We even got a check back from VU for using the agent they recommended and we got money back at closing too.  I really couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.  We love our new house!\\nVery simple, straightforward process. Your application gets to a lender in a matter of seconds and then you go from there.\\nReturn Sundays is crazy.

I have bought couches before and I have been allowed to exchange.\\nNever book your tickets from Sky-Tours! They are not trustable, and provide very bad service.  \\n\\nI booked my tickets back in January. I was going to travel in August, but unfortunately I had to cancel my tickets. Fortunately I bought a cancellation protection so I didn\\'t worried - or I though I shouldn\\'t worry, but this company is not trustable at all! \\n\\nEven though I bought a cancellation protection for 212 USD, I am going to lose about 400 USD, because of some policies their companies have that doesn\\'t make any sense at all - and the policies is not clear when you buy the insurance! They hustle you and are very greedy. When you try to communicate with them, they are just cheeky and don\\'t even know what customer service is! \\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to be hustled, and want good customer service and a reliable company - then Sky-Tours are not the website that you shall book your tickets from. \\n\\nFrom the even beginning I had trouble with them. My booking number change several times, I couldn\\'t find one of my flights, which was lost in the system, and everything was just a big mess! \\n\\nNow I have to book new tickets, but I have to wait 3 weeks to get my money refunded - and I am not even getting the right amount back.  But at least I know, that I shall never buy tickets from them anymore! This experience was a lesson to me. Never put your money in Sky-Tours.com.\\nThey were the bomb\\nI have purchased Frame with Glasses for my 4 year old daughter.\\n\\nAfter using it for couple of days, the frame started slipping down, due to which my daughter started seeing from the top gap.\\n\\nI need you to look for better quality of frames.\\nCard came in the mail in 2 business days and balance was as advertised.\\nVery easy to navigate the website.

Looking forward to my next watch already.\\nWith  persistence and patience with myself , Stephanie, my customer service representative found my frames.One of my four dogs  at Christmas ate my current frames.I called my optical company, and they said they would search for these particular frames.DEAD ENDS, with suppliers saying they were discontinued. I decided to search, myself... too many (1,038) websites that had these particular  frames,BUT discontinued.My daughter, who is an opthamologist, said she would help me search.After 3+ hours I came across RLE...my daughter,searched  only five minutes, came to me, and she tells me she found a website AND it was the same one I was on-TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,and they had the particular frames. I ordered them.I  finally after calling Replcement Lens Express-RLE (couldnt get through via phone) I wrote an e-mail to RLE.Stephanie replied,mentioning that CT had been receiving  horrific weather,and  it had affected business-I can relate-living In ND,It didnt  enter my mind, that this might be the reason. I thought I got scammed again-my Visa bank card was hacked and used at over seven stores after Christmas. Stephanie kapt in touch with me via e-mail, constantly...like I was an important customer. Finally, the frames arrived. My optical company couldnt believe it, and Im sure theyll remember your store name, because I raved about the customer service- Stephanie-and how she me feel at ease because they werent shipped RIGHT AWAY...she is the best!!!  If it hadnt been for the  severity of the weather my mind wouldnt have been thinking the worst... have been bed-ridden most of the time since November, so my mind thought of a few reasons for the delay.  It taught me a lesson-to be more patient, and if it hadnt been for Stephanie with CONSTANT status updates......and that all this is just DETAILS in the major course of our lifetimes.Thank you for EVERYTHING and thank Stephanie for her kind replies and updates.Sincerely, Judy A. Brown\\nBecause I cancelled my order and then reorder the different display. They never cancelled the first order and then second order didnt ship.

The 2nd time (a 50 minute call)  they blamed Costco for not having the policy.   Costco took over and called square trade to fix the problem. The 3rd time (a 45 minute call) they found the policy and proceeded to submit the claim of the on/off button not working.   Even though I have a coverall for damages to the laptop, they continued to ask me if there was damage or had it been dropped.   I am still waiting to get the laptop back.  If there is another option to square trade, I would try it.\\nGood experience all around and good looking shirts!\\nNow that I\\'ve started using Supplement Warehouse, I don\\'t think I\\'ll be able to stop.

So pleased that I have booked with Anywhere Peru for an upcoming trip in March 2018.  I have told all my family and friends all about the Costa Rica adventure and how pleased my entire family of four was with the trip.  The hotel accommodations selected were fabulous and beyond the quality that we expected.  All the adventures selected for the 9-day trip were super fun and engaging!   There was a great variety of activities to select from and lots of flexibility.  The travel assistant we used was easy to communicate with and extremely knowledgeable of the area.\\nEasy to find what I wanted.\\nWithin seconds a person answered the phone, knew who I was without asking anything (by phone number) and helped me change the order I had just placed. I was off the phone within 2 minutes. Very easy, friendly and helpful. I have never been so impressed! Keep it up!\\nNice, cause I can find out if a website is serious\\nI was unaware that I needed to respond with in 12 hours to confirm a booking number for a flight after entering all my information including my license number.Upon calling the business to see if my transaction could be further processed I was told no and that it was for security and that it was now my banks problem if I wanted to have my money back in less than 10 DAYS. In 10 DAYS the price for my flight will be higher so in the end this company has wasted my time and more money.\\nQuick delivery and huge selection\\n30 days to deliver, even over Christmas that is taking the biscuit\\nWe received six fruit trees, all large and although dormant, appear to be in great shape. The two year old boysenberries look very healthy. I had two separate orders and don\\'t know why, but they shipped the second order first, which was kind of confusing.  But it worked out in the end. One more tree to go, to be shipped next spring. Hope they remember!\\nAlex was excellent in helping us out , thanks\\nSecond time ordering from this company. Always professional and prompt. My package bees looked very healthy and happy upon arrival. Will continue to do business with them!\\nI love Fragrance.com!

Even to people like me who have been hiring there for c. 20 years\\nI absolutely love Delivery.com. It\\'s a no-brainer delivery site that offers amazing discounts. I highly recommend them!\\nI called, asking if they carried a particular brand/model of tire that I had used in the past. They informed me they in fact DID carry it. The salesperson on the phone, (J.P.), asked if I would mind telling him why I chose this brand of tire. I filled him in on the details, and he again asked if I would mind if he could suggest another tire brand. I informed him I didn\\'t mind, and he suggested Nexen tires. I told him I had never heard of them and he qualified his suggestion with a wide array of facts on this tire brand. I was impressed with his knowledge and told him I would take a chance and purchase the tires he suggested. He told me I had 30 days to make my mind up but was sure I would love them. I told J.P. I would be back in a couple of hours to pick the car up. Fifty-seven minutes later, I got a text informing me my car was ready! Four-wheel alignment included. When I picked my car up, J.P. was busy, so I didn\\'t have the chance to thank him and tell him I was impressed with the timing and service. After driving less than 1/8th mile, I was sold. These tires were MUCH more plush than my former tires. The service & price sold me on Town Fair tire. The quality and performance of the tire was the icing on the cake.\\nIt was pretty easy to use this site. I love the various payment options. Prices are very reasonable, my second time using this site. I\\'m excited about my trip. I just shared this site with a good friend, I can\\'t wait to find out about her trip.\\nI really like the brands you all carry. The Nautica brands are great. However, the graphic tees and the Ralph Lauren is extremely overpriced.\\nI bought a new Bvlgari watch for my wife at Jomashop. It\\'s brand new, except that the time was running way too fast for an automatic watch. It was running like 5 mins fast every hour. Given how unreliable the customer service is based on reviews and experience (online agent not very polite), I took it to a reputable local watch store for repair without even trying to communicate to Jomashop. The store claimed that the watch probably had an impact that caused the spring wheel to twist. It was a $100 fix, and fortunately, it\\'s not more than that. Given how cheap the watches and how unreliable customer service are at Jomashop, I believe it\\'s a good idea to buy watches from Jomashop but serviced somewhere else.\\nI am very happy with the work done, it has been very useful to me.\\nVery Impressed.  Ordered a plaque for my GF a couple of days after her Ace, we received it in the mail w/in 3 days.  Quick, accurate and professional.\\nSuper impressed! Super fast shipping and very well packaged!

True to size :)\\nDevon at Carhop in St. Cloud was great! He was realistic in terms of what I could get approved for and the process went smoothly. The cars aren\\'t that great and aren\\'t in the greatest shape but they do come with a warranty and they will do everything they can to help get things fixed. All in all it\\'s an okay place is your credit isn\\'t the greatest and you need a vehicle.\\nthe booking process was easy and straight forward. Very pleased with my price and confirmation emails.\\nI had been looking for the prefect hair accessories for my Bridesmaids for months and months, finally I stumbled across CoverYourHair.com and instantly fell in love!

The van load was due at the storage within a short time. StorageMart accommodated the need without additional cost. The staff was courteous and business like throughout.\\nI applied online and it only took a few minutes to inform me if I was approved or not and how much I was approved for.

I didn\\'t want the third magazine but I was so frustrated I just paid for it. Also, the website says that any orders over $100 that shipping was free and it was not free.\\nGreat service will recommend to everyone at a school\\nGot what I ordered when I was told I would get it.  What more can you ask?\\nAs a first time customer I found Promo Direct to be an excellent company to work with. What I appreciated most was the constant communication I had with my contact.

They are alot thinner than alot of over night briefs I\\'ve tried. But wow do they hold alot, and for me the cut fits me perfectly. I am 6\\'2\", 230, in case someone ready cares.

I would not do business with this company again.\\nIt really was enlightening. I would suggest everyone to take it as a reminder to be a defensive driver.\\nI love Thrift Books.  Great selection.  Easy ordering.  Quick delivery.\\nVery good. What made us believe in the company was when we called to confirm our car a real person from the USA answered all the questions.  We were not shuttled from one push this button to push that button. Please do not get so big you do not personally talk to customers\\nOur car battery died while we were away and we received excellent assistance when we got back.\\nThey gave me a good price for my books but it took a lot longer to get paid than I expected or even what was initially promised.

Low and behold, keep looking and found a $84.00 per night room at the Best Western Dulles that just blew my mind.  What a perfect find!  Saved a ton of money, so it pays to keep looking!\\nGreat fare price! Didn\\'t like the hidden \"seating assignment\" fees, but when I called customer service they said they would issue a credit-well, I\\'m hoping it goes thru as it will take 2-10 business days before I can see a credit🤔\\nHad a great experience with this website. Did not run into any issues.\\nIt is very easy to use.\\nI was completely thrilled with the tremendous discount I received on my room reservation. And the follow up Customer Service call from Cheapostay totally convinced me to use this site again. \\r\\n \\r\\nJEB \\r\\n  \\r\\nPhiladelphia, USA\\nI had a very delightful experience emailing back and forth with the Brian Gavin associates. They were very helpful and patient with my many questions.We were quite pleased with the engagement ring, which easily exceeded anything we were looking at in any retail store.\\nEverything worked as it was supposed to and in this industry that is what is asked.\\nI have been using R&G Brenner for the past 20 years and they always provide exceptional service.

I was super scared it wasn\\'t going to work but this website is 100% real and the dress is beautiful!! I wish I could post pictures\\nHighly recommended!\\nMy experience with Priceline was fantastic!  I didn\\'t have a lot of money but needed to go to Charlotte for a wedding!  Our entire family stayed at the same hotel and it was wonderful!  You can\\'t beat great service and great price!\\nI had my resume reduced from a long 3 page document to a 1 pager that stood out against the rest! It captured all my skills, key points of experience and made the information easy to read. My resume builder was easy to work with and made all my edits without issue. I have been called in for 3 interviews in the past two weeks thanks to my new resume!\\nI ordered several of their products, some of them are really overpriced for the quality. \\r\\nThey should definitely make sure that what they are selling are good quality products since it\\'s hard to understand what you are buying online.\\r\\nAlso the delivery time for their products it\\'s too long.  I am still waiting for products that I ordered in August.\\r\\nI am not sure why is it taking this long to ship items.\\ngreat product & comes in on time\\nI must admit I was nervous ordering a 1.77 carat ring online.  However, the ring is everything Brilliance said it would be.  My fiancé and I have verified the ring is authentic and exactly as advertised.  We took the ring to two different local jewelers.  Both the representatives at the jewelry stores where very impressed with the ring, as are most people that see the ring.  Both of the jewelers told me they couldn’t beat the price I paid for the ring.  I also was able to see the GIA laser inscription under a microscope at the jewelry store.  My fiancé was adamant about not ordering a ring online.  However, the diamond we bought is almost a full carat larger than similarly priced rings we saw at major, name brand jewelry stores.  My fiancé and I couldn’t be happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind, rings ordered during the holidays may take a few days longer to be delivered.  GIA laser inscription can take up to ten days; Brilliance has no control over this.  The wait is well worth it. I am a very satisfied customer.\\nThe watch is malfunction when I received it. It was 2 weeks ago and I\\'ve contacted customer support immediately. But I am still waiting for them to prepare a shipping label for sending back the watch for inspection. And I still have NO IDEA if I will get a refund, exchange or the watch to get fix.\\nTailor Brands are a fraud based service, I met the same issues of fraudulent charges as other victims here. Upon purchasing a subscription plan, they somehow sign you up for their subscription without your notice. And issuing refunded was not accepted.\\n\\nSuch unethical practice has been reported by other users. I think I will spread the words, meanwhile by clicking their Google and Facebook ad until I get refunded.\\n\\nIf they use this way to generating income, it is not a good sign. I believe they won\\'t last long in the business and Investors should stop funding such a company.\\nI paid extra to have my 3 item order ship earlier than standard and not only did it not ship on time  the shipping difference refund still has not been credited nor my items shipped.  Very disappointed....\\nIt seems too easy to be true.  I have been so nervous these first 5 months.  Getting collection calls and not paying my bills is nerve racking.  But FDR is doing exactly what they say they\\'re doing. I blocked all the collection calls.  Called FDR several times only to hear them say, relax, you\\'re doing what you\\'re supposed to be doing.  I make my payments on time and suddenly I am getting texts and emails about how my first settlement is ready.  Now that this first one is over I\\'m so excited for the next and to have all this behind me.  I\\'m so happy I decided to go with FDR.\\nQuick shipping and product was good.\\nvery fast serrvice\\nI have a 15 month old son whom is like many parents very precious to me.\\nI wanted to buy him something lovely for Christmas so I thought I would have a clear out and sell it on Ebay.\\n\\nI don\\'t have a lot of money so this extra cash would be fantastic help to me especially coming up to Christmas.\\n\\nSo I clock up sales on the region of £300  but I now find out unless I send the item via a trackable postage service I will have to wait 21 days ad a paypal are going to withold it.\\n\\nSo I pay the extra and upload all tracking information, true to thier word they release the money 3 days after a confirmed delivery.\\n\\nI wait until I have £100 approx that is released  and I request a withdrawal to a bank account they have already verified. \\nOnly to find 72 hrs later ( how long it takes them to process a withdrawal ) they have reversed the with drawback to Paypal and limited my account.\\n\\nThey reason they give for limiting my account is the change in activity. (From buyer to seller)\\nO have tried to communicate with them and they are like robots and keep hiving me standard response times that states my account will remain limited for 180 days.\\n\\nSo I have gone from being skint and wanting to make a few quid to being overdrawn and completely broke I don\\'t have a bean to buy my baby something for Christmas.\\n\\nI have sent over 500 emails those even going to Dan Schulman  (CEO) and Cameron McLean  (MD UK) and not one person  has had the common courtesy to reply or even send an acknowledgement .\\n\\nPaypal have taken thier fees and left me high and dry.\\n\\nAbsolutely appalling company no morales what so ever.\\nI\\'m still waiting on my refund\\nMy first experience was great and I didn\\'t have to wait so long for any results!\\nSuperior product quality. The website is easy to use and my orders always ship and arrive earlier than expected.\\nIt was excellent and very prompt as well.\\nGreat job.  The guys that delivered the mirror were just so professional and friendly.  I had a class of 5 and 6 year olds that had to start at 5pm the mirror arrived at 4:30pm they had it up and all taken care of by 5pm and there was no delay in my class schedule !  my next one will be from you !\\nI recently purchased a \\'desktop replacement\\' laptop through XoticPC and I have to say they are far and above the best of the best. I wont name any other names, but I had gone through 5 other companies to try and purchase a similar laptop. Trying to find a group of people who could give me a straightforward and honest idea of what I was going to end up spending, the timeframe of when I would receive my laptop, etc. All 5 gave me the runaround, and then XoticPC came through with flying colors. I honestly wish I could give them 6/5 stars because they even dealt with my terrible attitude I had left over from the other 5 companies being so false and impossible to deal with. Even with that, they kept their cool, reassured me, and dealt with me kindly and professionally through the whole process. I will not buy another custom built system from another company. Hands down. Bravo to the last internet company to provide old fashioned, timely, and honest customer service.\\nWe were looking for a great place to build our business and reputation. We found this fantastic office located in the lower section of wall street. It provides a spactacular view and some of the greatest customer support I have ever witnessed. With a divers staff and brilliant team of professionals that cater to your every need. The dedication of their day to day service and communications background brings nothing less then excellence. The aminities are awesome and filled with all the necessary tools to help you build a succesful business.  Servcorp, we\\'re glad we found you....!\\r\\nThank you, \\r\\nOpulentStyling.com\\nI learned about JustFly through Kayak actually, but will use it in future flight purchases! The simplicity of the process made everything very enjoyable, and the price was not beat by anyone!\\nBook in good shape very timely delivery during the Christmas season!\\nIt feels weird at first. You find them, they offer high level content, and it feels shady. I talked to a representative, he gave me a link, and I signed up. I\\'m glad I trusted them. This is a one shot group. No problem, easy peasy, just show up. No scam, no bull. They were friendly and, dear  god, they are pros. I wish EVERY heroic run was like this. Raid finder is put to shame. They crushed heroic Antorus, carrying at least 5 people, and made it look like a regular dungeon. 2 hours. That\\'s it. 2 hours... for full Antorus. I will definitely be using them again. If you\\'re like me, you have a shade of doubt, but they give you THEIR battle-tags, they send you confirmation via email, they ADD you to the raid 15-20 minutes before it starts, AND they keep you involved the entire time. I am impressed, I am surprised. I am doing this again, Thank you.\\nThis is my first purchase, so All I can say is that this one went through with no porblems.  Shipping was fast and free.  Would probably purchase from again.\\nI would recommend you to take a chance of trusting yourself by using this web .\\nVery easy and quick process with no problems.\\nVery help and understanding customer service will help in any way they can\\nI always use Newark Airport Long Term Parking for all my vacations. They run their operation like clockwork! On this most recent trip, as soon as I retrieved my luggage, I texted them and the shuttle back to the parking lot was already there as I exited the terminal. When we arrived at the lot, my car was already waiting with the keys in the ignition. The drivers are very friendly and help with loading and unloading heavy luggage. Their excellent service is worth the slightly higher price they charge compared to other parking lots.\\nExactly what I ordered, fast shipping.\\nWe had a great time. The cabin was beautiful and had everything we needed. I would go again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend staying here.\\nUsed the company for both Florence and Rome. Ignacio, Damiano and Anna were all superb. Friendly warm  informative made you feel that you were a friend they were taking around, rather than just doing a job. Highly recommended.\\nDelivered quickly and products worked fine.\\nOrdered and received the product as promised and expected.  No problems whatsoever.\\nI have used Travel Document Systems for many years to obtain visas and the company has always been reliable and timely.\\nI went to a local store to purchase a bug deflector, they didn\\'t have mine in stock. He mentioned ordering it for me, his price was almost double and shipping time was two weeks. That\\'s when I went online for myself and found you guys. Same deflector lower price and arrived quicker. I will be returning to purchase running boards of my car. Thanks guys.\\nMy order arrived as ordered in a timely fashion.  My only complaint. Is that I would have preferred to designate the value to assign to the gas cards I purchased, also. I wish there had been Hess cards available.\\nLoved this site..will definitely be using them again. Received books quickly and they were in very good condition.\\nArrived later than what was expected.\\nNot only the ebooks are of great help, but for those of us that prefer a hard copy of books, having the option of buying them at a low price ,and combined with a fast shipping, makes Springer Shop an excellent resource for us students.\\nHighly Recommended.\\nI bought a Groupon voucher and bought the scarves for about $7.50 a piece. The product came in a week and they wrapped it in a very good package. They have a lot of different varieties and colors which make it so hard to choose. The color was beautiful, I bought 4 solid pashmina in different colors and it all came even better from what I expected it. The material is soft and the quality is good. Soon as placed the order, i bought another voucher from Groupon. Now I just place my 2nd order with them. This would be a great Christmas presents. I\\'m looking forward for my second order to arrive. It\\'s definitely worth and i can see myself coming back here in the future. I would recommend those who loves scarves to check this site.\\nI liked the BOATERexam course for it short units, with video clips and diagrams. It was easy to sign up, log in and out as needed and complete the test. I ran into no technical difficulties. The provider was good enough to provide me with reminders about completing the course units (though not in the sense of overloading my inbox with junk mail). I had never grown up with knowledge of marine culture yet I was able to access the information without difficulty.\\nGreat service apart from trying to sell you extra imsurance\\nOne stop shop for all your dating needs. Everything you want from advice to matching sites.\\nMaria was great at communicating and getting us moved in!\\nMy experience with this website was great everything arrived on time. The address labels look very professional and unique. I\\'ll order again\\nEasy and very fast\\nI have flown often since 1992. \\nTravel agencies were first used and recently online. This week I decided to broaden my flight searches online. So glad I gave JustFly a chance. I really liked the free 4-hour cancellation option, as a last resort. The past three years I have flown solely on SouthWest. Now I will give Delta & United my business back!\\nWe were thrilled to find this ring online! It was the 3rd time my husband\\'s wedding ring was lost in our 15 years of marriage. I had been searching for a replacement and it wasn\\'t made anymore. About 2 weeks after my initial search I checked again, and there it was in his size through Ruby Lane! The price was right and it arrived in perfect condition. It was a very smooth transaction.\\nThe tank top was supposed to be 9.99\\nThe versatile sport bra was also from VIP section for 9.99 however I was charged quite a bit more\\nWhen it comes to purchasing items from Reeds, I\\'ve been very happy....as long as I purchase in the store.  I made an expensive purchase for Valentine\\'s online and was horribly disappointed.  My order arrived and fell apart right out of the box.  I was devastated.  Luckily, we were able to return it and exchange it at our local store.  I don\\'t think I will risk ordering anything else from Reed\\'s online.  I\\'ll just stick with purchasing in store.\\nmy flight into Edinburgh had been delayed and so I was late for pickup and the original booking had gone. I was grumpy and put out at having to settle on a slightly more expensive car but the young woman who helped me was totally professional and calm and when she spotted that I was having difficulty finding the car lights she came out to help further.\\r\\nI noticed a small scuff on the car the next day which I genuinely couldn\\'t account for. I was dreading insurance complications etc. When I took the car back, one of the office staff came out to tell the assessor that in fact the scuff had been present before ( not noticed in the dusk). I was so grateful and relieved. Fantastic outfit.\\nWouldn\\'t buy bags from here again ! Bags didn\\'t fit my bike I\\'m in the military so I\\'m moving duty station to Greece and they refused to return my bags since I couldn\\'t take pictures of installment with them on my bike . Worst company to buy from .\\nWe\\'ve used BookIt.com many times in the past ten years and never been disappointed.  Quick and easy and just keep checking back for the best prices.   Thanks BookIt!\\nI used Passports and Visas to expedite a passport for a business trip. Despite repeated assurances that my passport would arrive in time, it did not. They also were the worst I\\'ve ever dealt with as far as communicating information. My account rep never returned my calls on the day before my flight and just \"went home\" leaving me in the lurch not knowing whether or not I\\'d be receiving a passport. The other person on their general line who claimed to stay late to assist me did not. There was very poor communication and I had to miss my flight. Easily one of the worst experiences out there. Avoid at all costs.\\nGreat service! Thanks\\nGreenvelope.com is an amazing way to get the word out about an upcoming events.  They have beautiful invitations and the application is easy to use once you get the hang of it! The tracking ability for RSVP\\'s is such a useful tool.  I would highly recommend this company!\\nAlways had nothing but positive experiences. Always Excellent Customer Service.\\nExcelent. Booking was done online quickley ans smoothly\\nI ordered a piece of plexiglass online for pick-up.  I waited over a week before I finally called to see when it might be ready.  I was told at that point that the plexiglass was probably ready the day after I ordered it.  It would have been nice if someone would have let me know that earlier, since I could have picked it up when I was over in that area.\\n\\nThe company is great, and I have nothing but good to say about the products and assembly.\\nI am so disappointed- never again ZARA ! Was on holiday in Glasgow- I bought a dress , and it broke after 1 time wearing it. Called Zara, and got an unusable answer- that I had to return it in Glasgow again - IWASV ON HOLIDAY; FOR GOD SAKE ! I asked whether I could send it then - BUT NO , I had to return it physically- this is very bad customer service- if you can call this service.\\nthank you craig carter for professional excellent service\\nGreat service. Great prices. fast shipping. I received my daughter and my engraved stethoscopes the next day. This is my 3rd time ordering from them (unfortunately my 1st stethoscope was stolen). I love the color selection. I ordered a copper and black engraved stethoscope for my son a bright yellow engraved stethoscope and orange all fantastic.  I will be ordering from them again soon\\nVery easy and trustworthy\\nI have had great success with using this online storage auction site. I do wish that there were more online auctions closer to my home. Maybe Storage Treasures will partner with more Santa Clarita storage unit businesses.\\nExcellent customer service, fast and helpful\\nFirst class service.\\nI would recommend purchase of any equipment from Ingram\\'s.  They will work with you to help you accomplish your goals.\\nprompt service excellent place to buy plants\\nQuick response and easy application. Customer service was excellent also. The car buying experience was easy, finally! Thanks!!\\nI ordered the ladies x-large, which I usually order and it was big enough to fit another person in with me. Not such a big deal. However, the white T with the yellow writing, which was the one I ordered, faded so badly when I washed it that it looks like a 10 year old shirt that I\\'ve washed hundreds of times. I wanted to wash it before I wore it. Cold water wash, hung to dry. Now I\\'ll only wear it to sleep in.\\nMy car was picked up and arrived on time as promised with no damage. Excellent service and so happy I chose this company out of the many out there.\\nI used Craft Cuts recently for a sorority project I needed to complete. I made sure to have the order submitted ahead of time so I would have time to create the project. However, when the package arrived it was not my order. The inside label clearly had a different address and order. Although Craft Cuts resolved this, they did not exopodite remaking my order or express mail it to me. I wish Craft Cuts had taken it upon themselves to get the order to me sooner since it was completely their fault. \\nI was happy with the actual materials of my order which is why I am giving them 3 stars.\\nEasy, fast and convenient. Will use again for sure. \\n\\nThanks\\nI haven’t had a bad experience with any items that I have ordered from rainbow\\nJust found out that a trip booked through them (college kid home for spring break for a week) which I was charged $464.00 would have cost me $311 if I had booked directly through American Airlines.  I did all the work, then I had to ask for the itinerary after the 24 hour period.  There was a problem they created when booking the flight so I had to speak with American Airlines in order to get on their website to choose seats and enter frequent flyer info (how I came across the actual price of the tickets). How can they justify that mark-up.  Will never use this site again and will make sure people know what a rip off it is.\\nI have ordered multiple DVDs in the past and as always been happy with the service and the prices and the quality of the product. I recently reordered several episodes and again got excellent service and price and fast delivery. Would not hesitate to recommend oldies.com to anyone.\\nWell-organized site - very versatile options - like how they lay out the font and color options.  Fast, accurate service.  This is the second time I have ordered from Notepads Your Way.  I order half sized ruled pads for to-do and grocery lists.  Very convenient to have around. Nice quality product and I think the prices are quite reasonable.\\nalways good selection\\nCameron was extremely helpful.  He worked very hard to help us obtain the right product for our business.  He always kept us updated on the status of the process and explained everything in a professional and understandable manner.  As a repeat customer, we highly recommend Rapid Advance!\\nGreat prices! Fast order processing!. A really good website to shop on.\\nI\\'ve placed four orders so far. Easy to design, good prices and great service. I love having the same, timely and reliable account manager throughout the entire order process. Stephanie was awesome!\\nI have to say I enjoyed the bus tour but my family not so much.  The pre-recorded tour was boring for the kids. Some of the jacks on the top did not work at all. And since we had to redo one part of the tour each day to get to the other buses it was frustrating.  I do think we got to see quite a bit of DC on the bus but more overlap of routes would be better.  Especially on Yellow to downtown.  I did appreciate the Madame Tussauds being included in the fare price.  My kids really wanted to go so this was a nice break.\\nI have used this company for personal trips in the past and never had a problem; however I have now used them twice for corporate travel and both times the driver was late, this last time almost 25 minutes late. In both instances, the driver said they found out the pickup time 15 minutes in advance and couldn\\'t possibly be to me in 15 minutes from the location they were in when they got the call. So it seems to me to be a dispatch problem (?). I don\\'t know. This time I almost missed my train, it was very close.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS TIME, my driver drove an entire block the wrong way down a 1-way street. My head was initially in my phone and I looked up when I heard a slot of honking and people were waving at him.  Really?  Even if you\\'re not familiar with your area or a specific street, you need to follow street signs. He didn\\'t seem to think this was a problem as he turned the car around and proceeded to take me out of my way for another 10 minutes. The driver didn\\'t seem to be able to get out of his own way. He wasn\\'t familiar with the streets and although I tried to provide him with directions, he wasn\\'t able to follow them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike I said, I\\'ve used this company in the past for personal trips and although it\\'s been a long time, I didn\\'t have a problem. This last experience was horrible and this company seems to be going downhill.\\nVery unhappy with this rental start to finish. I voiced my concerns when I dropped the car off but nothing was done. I’ve exclusively rented from you guys the last several years but I will be looking to other companies for my next rental.\\nI like the way they teach you they make you use your head in the way they present the information.\\nI will order more of these belts. So simple, so light, yet so durable. I have multiple coworkers in the fire service that are interested in the belts as well. Look great with daily uniforms.\\nI paid for the service and my documents were never sent\\nThe cupcakes arrived and almost all of the rainbows and unicorns on top had cracked and crumbled. The cupcakes themselves were good - but the presentation wasn\\'t great.\\nI have two cats and a corn snake and travel quite frequently. I used trustedhousesitters twice now and can wholeheartedly recommend them. Both times, the housesitters I picked took really great care of my animals, sent me regular updates and were happy to help with any problems that cropped up while I was away.\\nI thought the membership fee was a bit steep when I first signed up, but in all honesty, for me, its worth the peace of mind knowing your pets are well-looked after.\\ngreat prices and excellent equipment with timely delivery!\\nLove the clothes, great variety, but trying to order online is a big problem, I place an order and then 2 weeks they come back and tell me they can\\'t ship it because it is out of stock, need to update inventory better.\\nI ordered the supplies on Wednesday and they were delivered to my door on Saturday.  What wonderful service!\\nI would say for the most part it was great but when I got to the storage unit pricing was a little different than what is spoken to the representative about. Regardless I saved money with sparefoot which if everything processes right, would be fantastic!\\nI was a little worried at first so I didn\\'t want to spend to much money on this so I got the 500 followers for like 7 bucks . I saw some post on here where they said it took days to get their followers or whatever so I figured I would time mine because the website says 10 min. Well I completed my order at 8:20 pm and and by 8:22 pm I had my 500 followers . So joke . This was the best . I\\'m actually about to go buy again!!! I would recommend this to EVERYONE .\\nVery satisfied with Juan G. Great service and professionalism.   Gave him 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\\nGreat prices\\nSeasoned travel company that has great connections at wonderful tropical locations.

Overall good service\\nSuper-fast shipping, very responsive customer service, and their extensive array of photos of all products leave no doubts whatsoever about what you are ordering. Worry-free shopping experience all the way around!\\nI ordered two novelty theatre-themed necklaces. I was shocked at the poor quality of the items for the price. These were intended to be gifts for my student directors. I guess I\\'ll have to add roses to add quality. :(\\nGreat product and fast shipping. Tickets met all my needs!\\nMy experience with VIP is very good\\nOrder was not delivered in the expected time frame. Placed on the 19th of November received on the 15th of December.\\nI\\'ve summitted my resume to a couple company\\'s. Received a few responses and you guys have gave me some great leads.\\nI love the price and the clothes! Everything that I have ever purchased has been excellent!!! I only wish they had more coupon/promo codes. Will totally do business with ModDeals again!\\nAfter comparing all of the websites where I could sell my cell phone I chose greenbuyback.com because of their high payout and great customer service. Awesome company!\\nI ordered a monsterhook from you guys instead of from the direct manufacturer. You guys were about $40.00 cheaper and it arrived in 3 days. I love the hook, it was the final addition I needed for my king ranch. Thanks guys.\\nTrip back on Pegasus was awful. I was in the isle seat and the middle seat was occupied by a 22 stone lump who took a great part of my seat as well.  The arm rests could not be put down.  The flight was full so I could not move seats.  People like that should pay for the seats they are occupying, that is two.\\nYour web site is easily navigated and your pricing is some of the best that I have seen on the internet.  I am looking forward to my next purchase.  Thank you.....\\nits too easy to get the insurance\\nOn October 2 I signed a contract with Leaf Filter to install their gutter protection on the back half of my house in Ohio, roughly 95 feet for $1,284.  Their salesman toured the site and wrote up the contract.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first crew came on time and seemed to be very qualified.  However, there was an issue around the hot tub where they could not use ladders and they had no scaffolding.  Since they could not finish the job, they decided to not start.  I talked to Leaf Filter\\'s sales manager Drew, who also was very professional, and let me know they would reschedule the installation.  This was set for October 17th.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 16th, I get a call from someone at Leaf Filter saying because they would need to use scaffolding, they were going to cancel the contract.  Mind you, there is no provision for them to cancel in their contract.  The guy stated they did not want to pay the cost to have scaffolding set up.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously, this type of action speaks volumes for the integrity of the company.  I was a bit taken back by the call, but now figure I am better off finding a provider with management who has integrity and stands behind their contract and their product.  I would recommend being very careful before hiring this company.\\nGreat buy!!!  Saved a lot of money with this purchase and it\\'s just as good as the name brand I was using.\\nMy wife and I travel from Australia to Sweden at least once a year and having previously had Alpha Flight Guru organise First Class flights for us at great savings, we did not hesitate to contact them again for departure in May this year.  We were given careful attention by Cris Acosta and yesterday he finalised return Business Class tickets for us from Sydney to Sweden via Copenhagen, at a massive saving.

Not happy with it, should go back to the old formula.\\nI\\'m sure there was no malicious intent but it felt unprofessional that the artist showed up about an hour late (after we thought she would come a few minutes early as the other artists did).  Luckily we had booked several people so we managed but I would think twice between hiring through them again.\\nMy experience with Career Builder has been satisfactory.\\nI am having trouble getting specifically contract/part time opportunities.\\nThere are many lessons, songs, jams, theory. BUT! There are not so much, as I wanted, metal songs, blues songs. Why you don\\'t review such famous metal bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabath, Rage?

I had first gone to Angie\\'s list and refuse the site because it required ME to purchase a subscription to use the service.  I did not feel comfortable with that and HomeAdvisor was recommended by my mechanic and I am happy I gave it a try!\\nFrom the moment I got to the store, the workers were friendly and helpful.

My item arrived very quickly, with no issues or damage. The bracket fit my truck perfectly, the only downside was that it didn\\'t come with mounting hardware (which I should have checked for before ordering). It was easy to mount on my front bumper in the spot designed into the truck for it.

I am glad there are websites such as this one to make it easier on the students wallets. Thank you.\\n3 weeks after buying from Buydig I\\'ve got no merchandise and no refund.  Their idiotic shipping policies, which they tried to blame on FedEx, that refused to allow FedEx to resend or allow me to pick up myself.  This resulted in it eventually being returned for basically no reason other then Buydig not wanting me to actually receive the on sale TV.  Their policy is that when a thing is returned you have to re-buy it, of course the return process takes so long that by the time you eventually get your money back, I still haven\\'t after 3 or so weeks, the sale is off and you now have to pay normal price. \\n\\nOn top of that their Customer service is horrible and extremely uninterested in actually helping you.  They only respond once a day and are only capable of a few responses that are unhelpful in the extreme and aggravating at best.\\nBest site I’ve ever used for buying books!

(I received a poorly spelled/worded response to 1 query 3 days after my initial enquiry, and am still waiting for a response to a critical issue after 4 hours today).\\n\\nIf you run a business, and your website is an important element to it (why wouldn\\'t it be?) then don\\'t use Wix. As a business owner, I simply can\\'t survive without customers and site issues are directly related to that. I would be ok with site issues if they were quick to fix, but they simply are not.\\n\\nI\\'m going to have to swallow the cost of my premium plan and move elsewhere which is a shame because my site looks amazing on Wix.\\n\\nI will add that I never experienced 1 problem before I upgraded and the 14 day cooling off period expired.\\nI ordered a set of t shirts and a mug from the site.

It took only two correspondence emails to send and view the proof plus the byline.  Approved the proof and had the buttons in a very short time.  They turned out perfect.

Right after my Mom & I got settled in, I climbed in the bed closest to the window.  I immediately hear a cell phone vibrating to the left of me. Both of our phones were on the night stand between us, so I started looking for this phone I thought may have been left by a previous person. Looked under the curtains, edge of the bed and between the mattress....nothing.  A bit later, Mom says, \"No, I\\'m fine.\" I ask her what she is talking about. She says, \"You asked me if I was warm enough.\"  Oh no I didn\\'t! I hadn\\'t said anything at all.  During the night (about 3 am) I wake up to see a dark shadow at the end of my Mom\\'s bed. It disappeared quickly. Then to top if off, later I wake up to pressure on my bed, like someone had sat on it!! This happened about 4 times!  I\\'ve never experienced that type of thing before, so I was a bit unnerved by it!  I\\'m wondering if the remodeling a few doors down stirred something up?\\nFast courteous and effective service.\\nThis is third car we purchased from auto lenders.

No locked in subscription or penalties.\\nTrusted the simply moving team completely & was not disappointed, only imoressed\\nTexas Power To Choose is the worse possible choice to assist you in getting a power company. The kick back they get must be really good, they recommended to us as the best possible choice TRIEAGLE power company with a 36 mths contract.

Love!!\\nApparently - what they say is 3 inches is 2 7/8 inches - and, it is a reasonable difference. However, when you call yourself Antique Lamp Supply - and then state that your lamp chimneys are made for specific lamps - then you are guilty of false advertising.\\n \\nRude people will not send a return label for postage so i can return the chimneys that were purchased by me under false pretenses - the DIMENSIONS ARE NOT CORRECT.\\n\\nTerrible customer service.

It has been my go-to vendor for optics and birding gear for myself and for recommending to others since I started birding in 2003.  So sorry you\\'re closing up shop.  My best to all at EO in your future endeavors.\\nWell I think my shirt was over priced a bit.. it\\'s a tank top and that\\'s why I think it is over priced..

She was proactive and concise to what was needed to get the job done fast.\\nGood service .\\nExtremely Happy with RentalCar customer relation and service and will definitely book through them again!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first time i booked with rental cars. I booked a car with GoldCar through rental cars. Had everything organized and ready to go. Arrived at my destination and GoldCar wanted to charge me extra to take the car i booked because of insurance. I was very frustrated as they wanted to charge me over 100euros for this. Unfortunately i had no choice in the matter as the other car they were offering me was to small. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as i got back i emailed RentalCars with my complaint and within a couple of days they contacted GoldCar and replied to me with GoldCar\\'s response. I told RentalCars that what they were saying wasn\\'t correct and sent them a detailed description of the story. After a couple of days RentalCars got back to me and told me that they were not happy with the response of GoldCar and gave me a refund for the extra expense i incurred because of GoldCar.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat prices and service!
