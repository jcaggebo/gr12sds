       "'I have ordered from Cover Your Hair twice, and always had the best service. Both packages arrived on time and in perfect condition.\\nWish I could post in the negatives, as this is all this company is! Stay faaarrr  away from these guys! Extremely dishonest company. Poor candidates and service. You could find better customer service at Wal-Mart!!! I could go on and on about how horrible this company is but I\\'ll just leave it as they are horrible in all departments. Go to Indeed if you are looking for new hires.\\n\\nUPDATE: In response to your response, you do not have your facts straight. I did not make a hire through you, I didn\\'t even get good candidates. You also did not line anything out clearly about a 4 day trial. You customer service team did not handle the situation. I was promised a call back from a supervisor and that never happened either. Stop lying and fix your issues!!!\\n\\nUPDATE: Never got my call back from Shay Williams. Emailed Sheena as requested and never heard back from her either. Don\\'t expect to ever have my issues resolved through them.\\n\\nUPDATE: A very nice gentleman named William called me back and resolved the issue. Thank you to William and I hope the rest of the ZipRecruiter team can learn something from you!\\nThe application was easy and I was approved quickly.\\nCustomer care informed me they no longer carry the extension kit for my crib. They were very polite! But their service didn\\'t stop there. They looked up other websites that do carry the bedrails and found them for me! What wonderful service!\\nWe have accidentally set the alarm off twice.  They have been very prompt in responding.  This gives me confidence in knowing that if the alarm is real, their response will be prompt.  It gives me peace of mind knowing they are looking after my home.\\nI bought a 2 yr plan on a printer.  2 yrs later when the printer stopped working I just happened to remember that I bought a service plan. When I called Square Trade, Izzy politely informed me that my contract expired 3 weeks prior! Ugh! It figures...always the consumer gets the short end of the deal in situations like this. However, It turned out NOT THIS TIME! HaHa! Izzy talked to his supervisor and he approved 100% of my original cost!!! UNBELIEVABLE! Izzy skillfully led me through the procedure with lightning speed and I received my check 2 days later! Square Trade is amazing! And so was Izzy!!! :) I\\'m a Square Trade customer for life!\\nGreat sweatshirt, sizing correct, came earlier than expected\\nGood price no delay faster service and easily website...nice to do business with you guys!!!!👍👍👍\\nAlways great value for money and quality accommodation\\nI\\'m quite happy with the products I order, although shipping is slow and rather expensive. I understand that isn\\'t really your fault since I do the cheapest shipping option. It does hurt when I order a large order and get smacked with duty afterwards. When new mood was unavailable to Canada I spoke with a customer service rep and they had mentioned that Canadian distribution would be coming. It sounds like that would end any issues I may have.\\nIt should be a big help when we use our car rental to find our way around Slovenia and helped us find the location of our hotel in Ljubljana.\\nEasy to order\\nAncestry is an excellent way to find out about one\\'s family history.  I\\'m so glad that I have joined.  It has brought me much happiness and information that I never would have known otherwise.\\nCalifornia Delicious is a great place to purchase gifts since they add a personal feel to their packaging. Makes the recipient feel that that I\\'ve really taken my time choosing and preparing the gift to them.\\nI had to change the dates of my trip on Amtrak and the charge to change was >$100.  I put in a claim online to recover the cost and the next day, my bank account showed the credit.\\nI ordered 6 pairs.  Out of the six, 4 are holding up well after two uses and a hand wash.  One of them, of another pair, falls halfway down my calf after a couple hours.  The last pair doesn’t stay up, not even from the beginning.  It’s worthless.  The socks that don’t slip down are great!  Love them.  Can’t use the other two, thus the three stars.  My only other critique is that they are hard to put on over your feet.  Once you are past there, they go on easily.\\n\\nUpdate:  The company replaced the two defective pairs!  Awesome customer service!  Not expected but appreciated!  Thank you very much! ❤️\\nWhenever I need to buy something I always head to the Amazon marketplace first because they have a huge selection of items to pick from and they are usually cheaper than what you would pay at the store. Other than being affordable you can see which items are actually high quality because of the reviews that other users leave for them, which I always pay attention to.  I also love the fact that I get all of my items in two days thanks to prime and I never have to worry about shipping costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n I do usually avoid furniture and other bulky items from Amazon because there is usually a shipping cost and it\\'s normally pretty high.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Update July 2015\\r\\n\\r\\nSince writing my original review I can happily say that I\\'ve purchased a night stand, a large sewing table, a Futon Frame, a few mattresses and a bunch of other bulky items from Amazon. With my prime membership shipping was free on each of these items and the price of them beat out every other option available. It\\'s hard to beat that, especially when you add in how fast Prime shipping is.\\nEasy ordering and quick shipping!\\nI’m very pleased with Marley Spioon - I’m able to cook and serve tasty and nutritious meals.  My elderly father who loves comfort food has liked many of the vegetarian meals.  I have been able to solve “what’s for dinner “, enjoy cooking and please everyone at dinner time.  Thank you!\\nI am a proud customer of mystery Tackle box! I love the Walleye box I get every month! The only thing I wish we could do as the customer is to be able to get more than one species box at a time on the same account. Meaning if I wanted the Walleye pro and the bass pro, I could buy 2/3 pro boxes a month. Also I would like for specialty boxes to be available more often like the hard bait bundle, soft plastic bundle etc... I was very happy with the bass hard bundle I received for the month of April 2018! Great job MTB on the products you provide us! Will continue to remain a loyal and happy customer.\\nTerrible customer service.  Misleading insurance costs.  Awful experience.\\n\\nI bought a ticket from Los Angeles to Addis Abbaba Ethiopia. \\n\\nI have to more people coming and but need to fly out the next day from New York.\\n\\nI asked to change the ticket and the change ticket fee is $350. \\n\\nBut if I cancel the ticket it’s $300 and the $100 of insurance doesn’t cover changing for this reason which was misleading.\\n\\nIt was cheaper to cancel the ticket and buy a new ticket.  I was ready to buy two additional tickets as well.\\n\\nSo then I decide to cancel. However the customer service person couldn’t not give me a veirificafion of cancellation. I spent 45 minutes on the phone waiting to get an email verifying that my flight was cancelled, that I would be charged $300 and get the rest refunded to me.\\n\\nOn top of that the refund won’t post to my account for 45 days. With no reasonable explanation for that. It takes you minutes to take money from my card but 45 days to reimburse me?\\n\\nSo I could have bought 2 additional tickets and you could have given me a reasonable change fee and reimbursed me at a reasonable amount of time but instead it was a terrible experience and I hope no one else goes through it.\\n\\nAfter I got of the phone I bought three tickets to Ethiopia from New York.\\n\\nI was also treated like I was unreasonable for wanting proof of a cancellation and that my refund would come back.\\n\\nThis is a one star booking service until you can offer a better remedy and solution.\\n\\nThank you,\\nGus\\nAs a family ranging from teens to toddler, Sling allows each family member to watch the type of shows they enjoy without channels that get ignored or unused. The prices are great and not having be locked into a contract allows entertainment to fit into our budget, as it may change from reason to season. \\nSling is the best options that will soon be the main go to way of tv entertainment.\\nThis program was so easy to understand.\\nBest place to buy/sell accounts\\nmy experience was great\\nEvery step went smoothly. Parts ordering to billing to shipping and delivery. Parts were correct and quality was good. Thank you.\\nGreat price, good service, prompt delivery. I had a good experience using this company.\\nPackage arrived as forecast and still frozen.\\nProduct is superb, best smoked pork chops I have ever eaten.\\nI have only had good/positive experiences with The Candy Club! Not only is the candy ultra delicious,  but alot of the candies you wouldn\\'t ordinarily be able to obtain at your local stores.  Originally I purchased my husband a 3 mo gift subscription as an Anniversary gift.  It wasn\\'t  long before we BOTH were anxiously awaiting the delivery day.  We\\'d track the pkg together,  text each other photos once the box arrived, send video Snapchats of the unveiling of the new candies we had & of course,  enjoyed tasting/eating the yummy candy.  Sadly, the 3 mo gift subscription came to an end.  Without any hesitation,  we elected to sign up for the 1yr subscription & up the # of candies we were to recieve monthly.  Now,  what once was a shared photo of the box on our doorstep, has turned into nothing short of a small Candy Club monthly documentary. Food for our marraige,  LOL. \\nI will say,  1 time we did have an issue arise (this was before they offered customers to pick thier own candy) , we recieved 2 of the same type of candy 2 months in a row.  I called to just inquire & the lady I spoke to, without ANY hesitation,  stated they were sending out a new box of candy immediately as a replacement.  They were very concerned with our satisfaction & by far made up for the error. \\nI HIGHLY recommended The Candy Club to everyone.  You never know.... it may just strenghten your marraige ❤\\nSo far I have had the internet services for a couple of months and it has been reliable for me so far.  Speeds fluctuate up and down, but my experience as a whole has been worlds better than Comcast.\\nI feel very safe in ordering on line and the service is very good. I am also comfortable with the prices, and speed of shipment. Very satisfied.\\nAgoda cancelled my booking without informing me. They cancelled it 2 days before we turned up at the hotel . 2 days in which they failed to contact me via the verified email address that they had for me or the 2 phone numbers on file. I was stuck in Milan with 2 small children in a fully booked hotel, (they had rebooked our room to another customer). An unhelpful customer service provider at Agoda just made lots of excuses, none valid. We managed to find another family room, difficult in Milan, for twice the price with the help of the original hotel staff. They were as cross with Agoda as I was. Never trust Agoda, book direct with the hotel or use other booking sites. We have never had trouble with Booking.com or TripAdvisor.\\nI will never use Agoda again.\\nThis is the second time that I have purchased flags from American Flags.\\nI am very pleased with both my purchases. The quality is outstanding, the price is good and delivery is very quick.\\nRepresentative was polite and very helpful in finding me the best insurance coverage that fits my needs. Thank you!\\nThe glasses arrived in a timely fashion via FedEx. The glasses are comfortable, and fit me well. I had the chance to try the frames out at another retail store locally before purchasing these through SmartBuyGlasses. Great pricing compared to retail shops found in Iowa City.\\nWebsite was easy to use and parts fit exact, for a very good price.\\nDelivery was quick.  Product was well packaged to avoid damage in shipment.  Product was high quality.\\nThe hard part was deciding what to order since there were so many choices. Everything went well. I would order again from them.\\nI am able to buy so many books for myself, daughter, friends, and family.  I would say that 1 out of 50 books may be a little worse for wear, and those are usually one of the toddler books I am getting. All of the books for adults are in absolutely solid shape.  The way I have been able to grow my library for such low costs is incredible.\\nExtremely helpful and kind. Went out of the way to make sure we could get approved.\\nWe would absolutely use TicketCity again -- the tickets were awesome and the customer service was fantastic!!!\\nGreat product.  Easy to install.  Shipping was a little slower than expected but satisfied with my purchase .\\nwonderful people very helpful recieved part I order fast\\nFrequent updates and new products added. Haven\\'t had trouble with them and got everything I buy from them.\\nThe six pages I printed felt repetitious...could have been reduced to 2 or 3 possible pages.\\nPoor unprofessional customer service. \\nDo not value customer\\'s time.\\n\\nThe site is ok so long as you don\\'t have any issues requiring to deal with the customer service. If you have to deal with customer service, be prepared to spend hours with no resolution. Customer service is mainly interested in selling services and charging fee even if it is their fault. They will provide misleading and incorrect information.\\n\\nYou will be better off dealing directly with airlines/hotels or reputed travel sites. \\nIf somebody from the site calls you to help, please be very careful.\\nOrdered the Ergobaby baby insert from Jackie, item was delivered promptly and Jackie was very friendly responding with a personal e-mail. Wish I\\'d ordered carrier from her too but went for Amazon although it turned out to be same price. Would recommend!\\nLove sony tapes for video work.\\nDon\\'t believe these reviews.\\nIf a company pays Trustpilot they will have a good review; if they do not then they make sure that they have bad reviews; until they end up paying.\\n\\nThere are so many more review sites that are infinitely more reliable than this.\\nI took advantage of a Leap Day special offer and made a reservation for $42/night (with taxes) in New York City, at a four-star hotel. If you go to NYC as frequently as I do, you know that $42/night would not get you an overnight stay at even a two-star hotel. Needless to say, I count this as a major win. Thanks Hoteling, what a great experience!\\nSo looking forward to our USA trip and experiencing Viator tours and hospitality.  Meeting the staff will be fantastic. The company I feel put the customer first.  I am sure this will be when we are touring with them.\\nThis was my first time using Enterprise Training School.  I was very impressed with program and the instructors.  I will use again in the future\\nI have been buying from this website for several years. The prices are unbeatable and the service has always been excellent! I hope they never change their business model.\\nService and quality is awful!! This company is scam ran by crooks\\nExcellent service!\\nI had a great experience dealing with Flashbay. I went with the natural wood usb product and it fits my business perfectly. Fantastic quality product and the printing of our logo is top quality.\\nNice food, nice servie\\nSo far i have good experience at ASAP over the years that i have been using them to buy  Plane Ticket. Representatives are doing the Best they can to help out their Customer in any way Possible. But this time i don\\'t know who to Blame. ASAP Ticket or PAL. I made special Request for my Immigrant Parents, considering their Age, and its their First Time to Fly. But NEVER got the Request That i asked. I\\'m so unhappy, Upset, and Disappointed.\\nThings have been great, for the most part but here are my issues:\\n\\n1.  The vegetables are hit or miss in terms of quality.  They are often withered and too small, and sometimes almost rotten.\\n\\n2.  Often times what is in the picture is not what is in the box.\\nFind one that is not found in other sites\\nSo convinced\\nThey are a fake Travel agent! Don’t ever deal with them! They charged my card many times and never answered me again\\nYou guys helped me out when I needed it and I would recommend my friends to you guys \\nThank you so much\\nI appreciate the courteous drivers, clean cars, and especially the fact that they are always on time or early, unlike other car services that I\\'ve taken.\\nI\\'m not sure if I will use again. The websites pics weren\\'t detailed enough . It was not the bottle I was looking for.\\nThe driver was there as promised snd drove safely in time to JFK.\\nFirst class service!!\\nI booked a round trip flight from Oakland to Istanbul (booking number: 6914487) and needed to cancel two hours later. This should have been plenty of time for my booking to be reviewed and any refund returned as the flight was two months away. \\n\\nI was notified I should receive 200 euros back on a 1,157 dollar flight. I never received this money. Under their own rules, I should have a refund from the U.S. based flights if not the other international flights as this was cancelled within 24 hours. This is in their own rules! I should have gotten at least 739.58 dollars refunded. I did not receive this, and I doubt Kiwi.com even attempted to get this back. \\n\\nI tried over and over to get in contact with a person by phone and through the company site. Nothing. Considering how bad this company is, I shouldn\\'t be surprised they don\\'t want to deal with all their angry customers. \\n\\nI am beyond angry and disappointed. This is theft.\\nAppalled at the time it took to 1. pick up my call (I rang twice as line went dead) 2. how long it took the operator to deal with my request. First experience with eDreams and would not recommend using. If I didn\\'t know better I would assume was a scam.\\nI ordered coral bells loved them will be ordering more soon\\nFast service. Super fast delivery. Web site good.  Futon good so far.  A bit too much “soft” up-selling when they call to confirm the sale (they call it recommendations). I bought the “futon set” but still was told the mattress needed $18 straps to hold it. Also quite a bit of encouragement to upgrade the delivery level. I would use them again.\\nwhat is the weight i am allowed to bring with me to new zealand.\\nEasy to use and great discounts...saved us half the amount. \\nJacob was a lot of help.\\nthank you very much\\nThe covered parking and pickup was great. We left our car for three weeks with no problems and we never worried about a thing.\\nI just had one issue - they sent me a different part than I had ordered.  I had to call and find out why.  They were very nice about it - and said they sent me an equivalent substitution (which they did)- because they had some issues with back-ordered inventory.  I\\'m fine with it, but it just would have been ideal if they had reached out to me to let me know - and let me decide what I wanted to do- given their inventory issue.\\nAs a first time customer I found Promo Direct to be an excellent company to work with. What I appreciated most was the constant communication I had with my contact. She kept me informed every step of the way. I will definitely be doing business with Promo Direct again.\\nAll books were in great condition!! The shipping was super quick!!!\\nI ordered gear from Onnit & everything fits perfect and they arrived at a timely manner. I seen owner in men\\'s fitness mag and reading his story he reminds me of myself driven business man. Thank you again \\nMitch Lopez \\nCEO- Jungledirt\\nThe suppliers on this site give you a fair price and fast delivery.I would recommend Ruby Lane anytime.\\nA wide selection of furniture catered to all costs.  Same day delivery and setup for a minimal fee.  Will definitely purchase furniture from there again and have already started telling friends and family to go visit the warehouse.\\nKatie was very professional and very helpful. They also delivered everything ahead of schedule.\\nExpert, reliable delivery service from people who always have the frames I need.\\nThe worst company i have ever dealt with, tried to return an item, their refund was Less than the purchased amount and they charged me a \"return\" shipment fee when I paid for the postage back to the return address. The staff don\\'t even read what you email them they just come back with absolute crap answers trying to justify it. Never use this company\\nI ordered a shirt that at the time said was in stock and was able to order.  After a week went by I got no shipping info so I emailed them.  They then told me the shirt was out of stock and gave me my money back.  It took me emailing them to find all this out when they should have let me know as soon as possible.  Second time this has now happened.\\nit was fun taking this online because of the animated graphics; I can\\'t imagine doing the same thing on any ither platform which wiuld have been boring and cumbersome. The information provided is to the point and it has definitely increased my knowledge of the rules, regulations and safety. Thank you comedydriving :)\\n3 weeks after buying from Buydig I\\'ve got no merchandise and no refund.  Their idiotic shipping policies, which they tried to blame on FedEx, that refused to allow FedEx to resend or allow me to pick up myself.  This resulted in it eventually being returned for basically no reason other then Buydig not wanting me to actually receive the on sale TV.  Their policy is that when a thing is returned you have to re-buy it, of course the return process takes so long that by the time you eventually get your money back, I still haven\\'t after 3 or so weeks, the sale is off and you now have to pay normal price. \\n\\nOn top of that their Customer service is horrible and extremely uninterested in actually helping you.  They only respond once a day and are only capable of a few responses that are unhelpful in the extreme and aggravating at best.\\nI used LeagueApps to effectively setup and manage upcoming sports camps this Summer. The user-friendly platform is extremely easy to learn and the LeagueApps staff is there to teach you through every step of the process, constantly communicating and responding to any questions or issues that arise immediately. I am thrilled with the site\\'s functionality and how easy it was to customize to specific needs. The design and engineering team at LeagueApps configured our web page\\'s entire design and did a fantastic job. I highly recommend LeagueApps and look forward to working with them in the future.\\nThey pick a winner so far very professional and sit down and explain in detail what need done and what is a priority and so far direct on with my cost and what my insurance pay Thank you 1800 dentist I stayed away from dentist too long\\ngreat prices and fast shipping\\nFirst, they misrepresented a color of an item on their Website, so I had to exchange it.  Second, when I called they promised that if I exchange, I will not be charged any additional shipping.  Third, I did a return and they charged me $7 for shipping.  Fourth, I cannot get to Customer service re this issue because they are \"too busy\" and they would not connect me to it.  Horrible! Is this a service that we expect from an Internet business?\\nThis is my first purchase from StockWiseAuto, everything goes smoothly and I saved money comparing buying from local Auto Parts stores.  Will be buying more from them from now on.\\nThe location to the hotel was very easy to get to. The atmosphere  was very nice. The front desk person was very polite and overall, my family  and I loved our stay at the Radisson!\\nWow this place really sucks, they shipped the product, so they say, over a week ago.  The status on ups still says it\\'s waiting for pickup.  I don\\'t know what the problem is, but I really need to get my license plate mounted to my car before I get a ticket or whatever.\\nI have had great difficulty in receiving product on a timely basis. Even after receiving part orders, \\'live chats\\' with an IdealShape CSR the resolution has been poor.  (The CSR did great, but his hands are tied by poor decisions/planning from others in the company).  As  much as we like the product, we are looking to switch to another as we simply cannot count on the distribution.\\nAbsolutely great. Very fast and straight to the point of what I needed. Would definitely recommend this site!\\nThis was an awesome experience!\\r\\nDrove in, parked, shuttle drove me to the airport and away I went.\\r\\nOn my return, I called, got picked up started my car, and away I went.\\r\\nLove this place!\\nThe shipping is SO SO slow!!\\nThese guys are great! Quality products and fast shipping!!\\nUsing this website was quick and easy. Wouldn\\'t hesitate to use it again.\\nI got a replacement tail light for  my F-150.  The price was so far below what a Ford replacement would cost that I was concerned that the item would be of substandard quality, but I couldn\\'t tell the difference between the two.  The shipping was expedient and reasonable.\\nI looked at several different web form software before purchasing Perfectforms, and your product outshines the others by far. \\r\\nI think you have done a great job with the interface, tools, and capabilities. My company has also contracted with your company to design and build a number of complex custom forms and we have no complaints from anybody that has used them.\\r\\nMy only wish is that the training and or help manual on creating my own forms was better.\\nit was great to be able to purchase and have delivered a gift for someone in the hospital at the Children Medical Center in Augusta GA while living over an hour away.\\nI bought a Garmin 45 dash cam, they charged me on my credit card, but I never received the camera, instead they returned it to themselves, they reversed the credit card transaction, and never gave an explanation of what they did or why they did it. The one thing I know is that I lost a $15 coupon that I used for the purchase, because they didn\\'t return that.\\nAs a special educator in Texas I find myself at odds with the school system for many reasons. The fact that my daughter has dyslexia and ADHD does not help this fact, nor does the fact I work with students who have special needs. Because of this, after my daughter had been in two different schools, and with my experience in several schools and districts, I knew I had to make homeschool work for her.  I enrolled my daughter in January 2017 in Enlightium, with the hope that she would have fewer stressors from school work, so she wouldn\\'t shut down or flat out refuse to do her work.\\n\\n Her first semester was a huge success. The curriculum was challenging for her, but not too, difficult. She was able to receive the one-on-one attention from me or a family friend who worked with her. She was also able to have the work chunked into manageable parts, so she could complete it in a timely manner and spend less time on school work. Also, since the work was online there were no more worries about whether or not it would get turned in to the teacher. I\\'m not saying any of this went off without a hitch, but it was much better than her spending 8 hours a day in an environment that overwhelmed her and caused a significant amount of anxiety to perform without the assistance she needed.\\n\\n Another bonus for both of us is the way Christianity and Biblical teachings are integrated into all subjects. It is done so in a matter-of-fact way, and points out that others may have different beliefs. The Bible is also used to back up all of the teachings and effects of believing or not believing in a loving  God.   \\n\\nI cannot say how grateful I am that Enlightium Academy is available. If you are a parent who wants you child to succeed and excel then I believe Enlightium will work for you and your child if you are willing to work together. I can\\'t wait to see what this year brings for my daughter,  how she has grown and will grow.\\nThe part was ordered on a Sunday night.  PartsGeek sent out notification to FedEx on Monday.

It arrived on time, but damaged.  iCanvas customer service quickly responded and sent me a replacement.  Unfortunately it did not arrive on time and even more unfortunate was the greater damage on it.  This one had a large gash on the box which pierced through the print!  Needless to say, I was upset.  iCanvas again responded quickly and accommodated my request for a full refund.  So great service, but needs to either improve the quality of their packaging or change their shipping partner.  This frustrating experience was enough to keep me from ordering again. Sorry.\\nVery easy touse\\nI questioned Agoda about a previous hotel booking that despite showing on my Agoda bookings page, I did not receive the points and I was told they had stopped giving points for feedback. I was disappointed that it is too easy to make a booking without realising I was not log-on and I had not been told they had stopped the points for giving feedback. Although Agoda were timely in responding to my emails it was not sorted. However, I have used this website many times without any other problems.\\nMy experience is before im sending to other exchange but my mother complain that the money they get it late either on next day or need to wait long time.but since i change to express money uae exchange.it is very fast they get it and now no more complain.thanks for uae exchange\\nTHE ONLINE AND DIRECT CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE WAS WONDERFUL.

They are fast, honest, and just generally an excellent company. All of my orders are shipped speedily and I get them in no more than a week including business days when they are shipped from across the country, no matter if it\\'s holiday season or not. The prices are so competitive, I have never found a cheaper source of books. I have order test prep books for $3!!!! The original price of which would normally be at least $20. The books come in Acceptable, Good, Very Good, Like New, and Brand New condition. But the condition is always great no matter which condition I order in, which is most of the time the acceptable condition.\\nOver I have not received the items I ordered for my Grandson for Christmas. At this point I do not even know if it has been shipped yet. The other thing I did not like that anything I order has to be shipped to me when I would like whatever I order shipped to my kids.

They cater to their customers and it is so nice to come back to a warm car in the cold winter months. My only complaint is that I did request covered valet and I am sure it was not covered by how dirty the car was. The valet also changed my radio station and had some hip hop station blaring when I got into the car. Not a big deal but I really see no reason to mess with the radio in patron\\'s cars. I will continue to use WallyPark for all my trips especially if I can get a groupon deal to lower the price.\\nEasy to get a hold of and always being taken care of!!\\nI was very pleased with how easy it was to order and we received the dress in a week!

I asked for $2500 and I was told I qualified for $4,500 which was great! Well, Jessica Hakenson emailed me to fax my docs so she could deposit the funds. When I did, I had to call repeatedly before I rec\\'d a cb from her. I had to email all my docs to her again. Then, she emailed me at 7:00 am pst to tell me I couldn\\'t have the loan due to my bank act being overdrawn in the month. I have overdraft protection plus another bank. I wasn\\'t even asked what happened. You are not a reputable company. I\\'d hate to think when you saw my driver\\'s license, you changed your mind. I don\\'t believe any positive reviews.\\nI was not able to cancel a 5 minute old reservation for a West Houston location for a South Houston location using the Live Customer Service Agent. Free Cancellation? $7.99 was charged to my card for Cancelling and rebooking at a different location. Not to mention the 10 minute phone call, only to be told I would have to cancel and change the booking myself on line.\\nLarge inventory, good prices,products arrive quickly\\nI have utilized Air Filters Delivered for the past several years and have the highest regard for their company.

New customers will be very pleased.\\nBest rental car service in the industry. Great cars, great service, affordable pricing, responsive to all customer needs.

Paid a fraction of the cost for a yellow diamond and when I had the diamond inspected and insured none of the \"experts\" could tell the difference.  I did have to return the diamond to be fixed as a one of the smaller white diamonds came lose and fell out, but it was replaced no questions asked.  The purist diamond purchaser may turn their nose up to a enhanced diamond but I certainly could\\'t be happier.\\nLoved it and I am very happy with it.\\nAdt communication & service was beyond my expectations!\\nfound exactly what i was looking for at good price.\\nI Love JustFab!

But I got one used book that was in very poor condition--looked like a child drew a circle with a pen on each page. It was just for home reference, and a good price, but I was sort of surprised that this book was even sold. I\\'m glad I wasn\\'t planning to give it as a gift, as I was one of the other used books I ordered, that was in great shape! So, sort of mixed results for me from my order. : /\\nI ordered a phone case from them back in 2014 (that is still in excellent shape today) but I bought a new iphone and needed a new case so decided to order from them again. The new custom case I received was absolutely horrible, totally green in color so I requested to return it for a credit to get another case and they just issued me a credit within  hours of my request and I didn’t even need to return that ugly green case. I ordered another custom case that  arrived today and the  print quality is just as awesome as the one I ordered back in 2014. Very happy I didn’t just give up on them, they really do amazing custom print phone cases (my green colored one must have been a miss quality control but they rectified it without any problems) Thank you Zazzle, you have a customer for life!\\nExcellent book quality, great prices, fast shipment!

In fact there was a moment when I wasn\\'t so sure I wanted to go through with it. You read the positive and negative reviews and it\\'s up to you to test your luck so to speak. I finally decided to take a chance and the worst case scenario based on a negative review I read is that it would take awhile to receive my refund.When i received my rings I couldn\\'t believe it. I immediately knew that I found a place that I will purchase my jewelry from for life. The ring is absolutely stunning. When I proposed she cried and cried and spent the rest of the night staring at her finger. I can\\'t even count the number of compliments we have received. I still look at it with amazement. If you\\'re reading my review it\\'s true. I have not been paid to make this up. That was an issue I had during my research phase because I wasn\\'t sure who was behind the typing. I will NEVER shop anywhere else they officially have my business for life. Thank you PrimeStyle!\\nYears of trail running and mogul skiing had left my knees in continual pain. When my Ortho doc had no solution and suggested it was time to give up running and skiing, I was devastated. Having heard of stem cell therapy, I made the easy decision to give it a try. My first treatment fall 2015 provided great results with pain free bump skiing that winter. Spring running revealed some dull pain though, so I had a second treatment summer 2016. The result is amazing! I\\'m running and skiing as fast and as hard as ever at 62 years old. This science is very real and incredibly effective.\\nEasy to do business with.

My new home is in a rural area and only days before closing did I learn that ATT was NOT in fact the internet provider listed on the sellers disclosure. I often work from home and connect through a VPN  and use a VOIP for calls,  thus I rely heavily upon a strong and reliable internet connection. She was able to secure a provider with no obligation in the event the service did not meet my needs. I am very grateful for the extra mile and what she did for me.

Add in free shipping, plus no sales tax and there\\'s no reason to shop anywhere else. I use to shop at GNC and the Vitamin Shoppe, but not any more. PureFormulas beats those other brand name stores \"SALE\" prices for the exact same supplements. Also PureFormulas\\' check-out process is quick, safe and painless, unlike other online stores. So as long as they don\\'t change the way they do business, I won\\'t change where I shop.\\nThe experience that I have they always trying to helping there customers and I\\'m so glad I\\'m happy the gentleman that he helped me he has a extension number (815) he\\'s great if I\\'m not wrong his name is Daniel .

Then, he didn\\'t know enough Spanish to conduct the transaction so I did it anyway. Which wasn\\'t a problem, I preferred this since I speak Spanish but I would have appreciated if at the beginning he just mentioned that I needed another code and I could do it online or he could. That way I could have made my own choice.\\nGood price could be a little better delivery.\\nI phoned to inquire about font size for my Rack Card.

Most good thing is good quality and choices. M13H0974\\nJust wish the two capital letters necklace came in the tiny name.\\nI\\'ve set up the website really easy, without help. I\\'ve changed 3 times the theme of the website and are many more that I want to try. I can manage the website easy and I can make changes when I want.

The customer service is great, too!\\nI wish there was an option to compare specs of one pair of binoculars with another on the same screen without having to navigate back and forth. Otherwise, amazing products and great service. Thank you!\\nApparently - what they say is 3 inches is 2 7/8 inches - and, it is a reasonable difference. However, when you call yourself Antique Lamp Supply - and then state that your lamp chimneys are made for specific lamps - then you are guilty of false advertising.\\n \\nRude people will not send a return label for postage so i can return the chimneys that were purchased by me under false pretenses - the DIMENSIONS ARE NOT CORRECT.\\n\\nTerrible customer service. I will find another vendor.\\nHad a minor issue, was contacted immediately by a representative to took care of the issue.

At a very good price.  Then realized I could go to Chevey and get them to cut me a key since my switch wasnt bad. The return and refund was greatly appreciated and timely. Thank you\\nAT&T is an amazing company that has helped me reach my business goals, that would not be possible otherwise. Don\\'t listen to these other people who are just crazy about T-Mobile, Verizon (etc). Go with a network to you can trust. \"AT&T Rethink Possible\"\\nI was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the products I received from Matboard & More.  Having never used them before I was tentatively waiting for the items to arrive but I was very happy when they did.  I would definitely use them again and recommend them to others.\\nI was in desperate need of some bullnose tile and my local supplier could not find a supplier that could deliver for 7 weeks!  With hesitation, I took to the internet.  WOW I couldn\\'t have been more surprised with the customer service at TilesDirect.  They were amazing!  They responded with confirmation of the bullnose I needed, the quantity, and shipping options.\\nEmail updates and final shipping notice was spot on.  Tiles arrived and shower will be operational sooner than the 7 week delivery I would have been faced with.  THANK YOU TilesDirect.  Shop locally for your selections and then order from TilesDirect!!

AirBNB charges a Percentage on the accommodation fee, so I requested a 50% refund of the service fees. They kept saying the host short changed me. Asked me to file a claim against the host! But the monies refunded by the host tallies. It is the service fees that was withheld by AirBNB!\\nMiles Kimball has been around for ever it seems.  They are a great company with tons of stock......everything you\\'ve always been looking for\\r\\nbut haven\\'t had a clue as to where to look.  It\\'s a mail order company, that is very dependable and reasonable. Check them out! I sure am glad I did!\\nMy dog is always eager to get to Arisa\\'s house on days I leave him there and it\\'s clear she is fond of him as well, as is her family.  I don\\'t worry about him at all because I know he\\'s well cared for, has companions to play with, gets walks, etc.  As she lives so close to me the convenience awesome as well.  You can\\'t go wrong with Arisa, her dogs, her family, and her HUGE backyard.\\nNever a problem books are in co diction they as they are described.\\nI have not had a claim so therefor I have no option has of yet.\\nIt was a hassle free and quick way to book a car.\\nIt was an easy process with stress free waiting time.\\nexcellent except when they close your account for security reasons when there is totally no reason. To get back is a nightmare!!\\nGreat service\\nFast service. Good product.\\nFirst time buyer. Easy transaction. Like that they offer PayPal for payments. I would do business with pro civic again. Keep up the good work.\\nI was really happy with both the service and the part. I had no trouble with the installation. It went together perfectly and problem solved.

That is when I will be able to tell if you guys are good or not.\\nlooks great and won\\'t break if dropped!\\nI made an order though recharge.com and It was credited almost immediately to the phone number I sent it to back home. This has been at least the fastest recharge service I\\'ve used.\\nTook way longer than expected and to get an answer took a whole day. Didn\\'t get all of the hardware that should come with it.\\nEasy to use and navigate. nly issue is when you ask for lowest price and for that to be sent in an email, it doesn\\'t always give the lowest fares.\\nThis item was out of stock and it took a week to get notified. Ordered it from somewhere else only to find out in two days it\\'s was out of stock and it was to be shipped from same place as this. Would help if it was marked out of stock before I went to the trouble to order it.\\nSuch good quality clothes!\\nThe only reason I am giving one.com 1 star is because technically I can\\'t give them a 0 star.\\r\\nFirst, on the main page of their site they loudly claim\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No strings attached!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are free to cancel your subscription anytime, should you wish to do so.\\r\\nAfter the first FREE year, your price for the web hosting package is only 1.45 USD /month\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then they deceive you with their it was mentioned in the terms and conditions and make you realize that the tagline should have been rather been \"several strings attached\".\\r\\n\\r\\n1. One.com expects you to manually Cancel your subscription 1 month before the expiry of your hosting plan by contacting their customer care, otherwise you are auto renewed and charged for the subsequent year. Unlike other well known hosting providers who cancel the hosting plan by default on non payment of renewal fee(unless the customer decides to go for auto renewal), One.com forces auto renewal on all it\\'s customers. As of reminders about the expiry of hosting plan, while others send atleast 5 to 6 reminders, One.com sends only 1 reminder, having missed which you are bound to be auto renewed. The Customer care is prompt enough to show the terms & condition to the customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. After the expiry of due date(15 days before the expiry of the Hosting Plan), one.com expects you to Pay an extra 12$ as a reminder fees every time they send you a mail reminding you to pay your due amount. So expect a bill of somewhere around 12$ every month as reminder fees, in case you fail to pay renewal fees for a website that was forcibly renewed without your consent. The customer care have their usual excuse \"Please read the terms & conditions\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The web hosting package for which you are supposed to pay $1.45 every month after expiry, apparently doesn\\'t include the domain name. For the domain you are supposed to pay an additional $13.8/yr, thus making the grand total of $31.2/yr. Inspite of the fact that the web hosting package you bought actually contains a domain and One.com itself claims in it\\'s main page \\r\\n\"Web hosting - everything included\\r\\n5 GB Hosting space\\r\\nDomain\\r\\nFREE Website tools\\r\\nUnlimited transfer\\r\\nUnlimited email accounts\\r\\nCloud Drive\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. One.com\\'s Customer Care is perhaps one of the worst in the industry and for everything they have a single answer \"We have mentioned it in the terms and condition\".\\r\\n\\r\\nI made a huge mistake of disregarding the negative reviews about one.com and bought a web hosting plan trusting and expecting them to be customer friendly. Alas, I became a victim myself and now I am forced to write a review about them to warn others and let the company know that if they don\\'t change their policies and continue scamming people with their \"terms & conditions\" then sooner or later they would be forced to pull down their shutters.\\nI decided to go with Quicken Loans for my latest home loan and glad I did.  There were 3 people that made it all happen: one that started me off with the credit checks and pre-approval.  Then another to help my loan get expedited.  And then finally one to help me close.  At first it sounds like there is potential for a lot of miscommunication but not at all!  Each person was easily accessible.  I would definitely use them again.\\nThey were easy to get a hold of and ask questions, someone was always available.  I could see the progress on-line.  They helped guide me with the checklist.  I had my Passport processed and back to me in 7 business days just like they said from the time that it was with the consulate.  I am a very happy customer!!!\\nI ordered a bracelet from Reeds Jewelers rather than ordering direct from the company that makes the bracelet because Reeds offered free shipping and no tax.  My order was shipped within a matter of hours from ordering and I got it a couple days later.  Would definitely order from Reeds again.  Thank you.\\nI have met Uber drivers who were approved for Uber but did not pass the background check with Lyft.\\nExcellent service and very good customer services. On time with their services as well . Definitely will buy again in the future.\\nThis is my 2nd order with GW. The 1st time my sofa pillow came busted at the seam and took months to be replaced. This time my cocktail table arrived with no stoppers. I have some extras that don’t really fit but I have to wait 1 week to get the proper parts. Also I noticed scratches on my cocktail table but didn’t complain cause who knows how long it’ll be until that gets replaced. I’ve already decided to make my next purchase elsewhere.\\nI belong to a paperback swap club but many of my favorite writers and titles are long, long waits; like up to a year or even two years to get. Ah, here\\'s where Thrift Books filled my desire and now I cut the long wait list for many of these books by ordering from Thrift Books. They ship fast and at a great cost savings. The three book order with no postage makes it even better! Fantastic inventory in about any genre you looking for. And you can even get alerts for books your looking for if they don\\'t have it presently. You can\\'t beat the price, quick service and vast inventory of titles. Thrift books made my dreams come true especially in finding \\'hard to find\\' books and authors.It\\'s my go-to site hand down! Gery B.\\nGood job nice price\\nQuick delivery,  wouldbuy from again and would recommend.\\nGreat service and fast admin service...\\nExcellent price match and search.

When I made my 1st purchase from you I was amazed at the quality and size of plants that I received.  The plants are always of the best quality!\\nI could download my ebook instantly.\\nI am completely satisfied with the level of service received. They delivered ahead of schedule and maintained communication during the process so I never had to wonder what was happening.\\nIt\\'s good and I got excellent advice.\\nGood food ,friendly service\\nExcellent Service\\nI use My US every month and have done so for a number of years without a hitch. The last 2 times I experienced a glitch in creating my own ship request. On my home page, when I press the \"create ship request button\", I get a message saying that one or more of my packages cannot be shipped and that I need to contact customer service.  This message comes up despite none of my packages being ön hold\". Today I was served by Tyler M.  Tyler was courteous and prompt.  However, I had to state my problem 3 times before he agreed to create the ship request on my behalf as I was unable to create it myself.. I stated my problem in my initial chat request comments; I reiterated my problem when asked how I could be helped.  Tyler then suggested I try choosing the shipping carrier myself.  I told him that I could not even get to that page.  He told me try it myself.  I tried and could not.  It was only then he agreed to do it for me.  We got there in the end but it was a drawn out process.\\n\\nWhen this happened to me in November, the My US consultant got my problem immediately and created the ship request.\\n\\nObviously I would much prefer being able to create the ship request myself, as I have been able to do for years, apart from November and December of this year. I\\'m not sure what is causing this problem.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nDominic\\nOrdered two hoodies.  I received a email saying that they were shipped, never received the order. \\n\\nNever responded to my emails.\\nI ordered some items to update my dinnerware & a really nice NINJA FOOD PROCESSOR for my kitchen !!!!! \\r\\nwhen the items were shipped .....the packaging was extremely protective for the heavy place settings!!!!!\\r\\nI am impressed!!!!!!\\nTimely shipping. Great customer service when I cancelled and reordered rugs because I decided the first set were going to be the wrong color blue. Love the rug I did order. Color is perfect.  The wool nap is thick and dense. Great quality for the money.  It is shedding badly with vacuuming. Hope it stops soon.\\nI found the prices to be excellent, and when I followed through with the confirmation number, all was set.  My only issue was the tickets went down in price significantly within 2 days, but that is not their fault!   Economy shifts!  Dang!  I should have bided my time a little longer!\\nI really appreciate Philip\\'s timely help as he helped me immediately without wasting time.\\nI had bought some pj\\'s \"My Heart Belongs to Princess Chloe\". They are so cute. Love, love them.\\nGreat deal!  Received quickly!\\nI order greeting card folders and candle bags from ClearBags - the price was reasonable and delivery was excellent\\r\\nthank you so for keeping me crafting\\nThe worker honored my time frame and was very patient with my questions\\nThe process has been great so far.

I still have quite a ways to go but overall I am satisfied with the progress\\nProduct exceeded expectations. Delivery was exactly as promised\\nI had a very pleasant experience ordering a case of wine. The wine was procured quicly and communication was good during the process. Pricing was fair. Overall, the service was great and I would trade with Saratoga Wine again.\\nI\\'m a true testimony that Oakmotors and IFC are wonderful. I\\'ve gotten five vehicles from them and each experience was pleasant. They really help your credit score also when I got my first vehicle mine was around 240 now I\\'m @719.\\nJenson has a lot of eye catching bike accessories.  Accessories that, perhaps, you had not considered before spotting them on the website.  Such was my experience.  I visited the site expecting to purchase tire tubes and a tube repair kit.  When my visit to the site was over, not only had I purchased the tubes and repair kit, but also a set of sporty fenders that I found difficult to resist.  JENSON IS BIKE PEOPLE!\\nTransaction went smooth\\nWe ordered two mugs from CafePress and while we received them on time and they were what we ordered, we thought the designs we chose would be located on both sides of the mugs.  They were perfect except for we would have preferred designs on both sides so no matter how we handled the mugs we\\'d see the scenes we wanted to see.\\nGreat arch support! Love my Oofos! Would like more styles with more support around the foot too.\\nEasy to use, very convenient dash board. Like the product.\\nExcellent quality. 100% satisfied!!\\nink came in an expedient manner and the price and quality is great\\nExcellent seller, I highly recommend .\\nThe driver phoned me 10 before pick to say he was waiting. Very safe and efficient ride from the Westside to New Jersey.\\nI’m happy that I am on my way to a life free of debt.\\nI created a class on history and technology and was able to find all of my text resources using Thrift Books. As a school teacher most of my resources are straight out of pocket and it was great to be able to track down just what I needed while saving a bundle over the cost of new. My students love the DK Technology and Invention books and we all send a big thank you!\\nWe received my Visa back in the time frame described.  We were very relieved.  Thank you!\\nWe have used EasyKeys for several years now, and I recommend it to my clients.  Their prices are certainly fair, their product ships accurately and on-time, and they provide excellent customer service should you have a question.\\nWish I could give a higher grade than just 5 stars.\\nDxL is a good place to shop they always have your correct size and if the store don\\'t have ot the salesperson will do it\\'s best to get the most. Information on the product you want\\nI can highly recommend TrustedHousesitters to anyone who likes pets and likes to travel. It was a great experience for me and my boyfriend. We spend a lovely week in a beautiful house with great dogs. It\\'s an incredible opportunity to travel and live like a local. Our best experience ever :)\\nI just rented but haven\\'t moved items in yet.  Staff member was very professional and pleasant.  Look forward to working with her.  Thanks\\nI am not fully satisfied with your services. I paid with British credit card and you could not convert Polish  currency directly to English. You have done it frough converting indirectly via €s.\\nI reserved a unit early on a Monday morning. The process online was super easy and quick. I received a call shortly after from my local Life Storage center that I could come by anytime that day before closing (6 PM) to get my keys - no other information given.  \\n\\nI was also planning on moving in that same day. I borrowed two trucks from friends and hired a babysitter to watch our son while my husband and I loaded up all of my stuff to be moved in. We show up to Life Storage at 1:30 PM to grab the keys and move everything in, but as a surprise to us, the offices were closed. They had a sign on the door saying they were all out for lunch and would be back in an hour. I was quite annoyed because there was no mention that they\\'d be closed for lunch in the phone call I received (he said I could come by anytime before 6 PM). And now we had 2 truckloads of boxes that had to be taken back and unloaded so we could get the trucks back and we had to go pick up our son as the sitter could only keep him until 2 PM. \\n\\nAfter going through all of that hassle, I did not want to lose my unit so later that afternoon I ran by the center to sign the contract and get my keys (still not sure when I will ACTUALLY be able to move in). \\n\\nI show up and casually let the guys at the front desk know that I was a bit frustrated because I had shown up earlier in the day to move in and no one was here and it caused a huge hassle for us. The guy at the front desk did not even acknowledge me. Not even an apology. He literally ignored that I had said anything and just asked me for my drivers license. \\n\\nIt didn\\'t seem worth causing a scene so I just moved along with the check-in process. A few minutes later he asked me when I was planning on moving in, and I told him I didn\\'t know anymore because we just had to take all of my stuff back and unload it and had to take the trucks we borrowed back because they were closed when we showed up. Again, he COMPLETELY ignored me. Didn\\'t even acknowledge that I said anything. \\n\\nI get that things happen. The fact that they were closed for an hour during the middle of the day when I was told I could come anytime was annoying, but it happens. But to completely ignore a customer who is voicing a complaint is just bad business. At best I was hoping to have the $25 administrative fee waived for our trouble and at the very least I thought I would get an apology. I got neither. \\n\\nAll in all, the storage center seems nice, clean, and functional. Just call ahead before showing up to make sure someone will in fact be in the office (even if they said they will). Having to move is already a stressful event in itself, so this bad customer experience made it even worse. \\n\\nHopefully it will be a better experience from here on out. Now I just have to borrow my friends trucks, hire a sitter, and do this all over again.\\nExcellent customer service and communication. My purchase is everything I expected and more.  I  have recommended Leibish Co. to everyone who tells me how beautiful this fancy diamond is I purchased.\\nOrder cam alignment bolts for lower Control arms. Only got 1. When there is two control arms. And very slow shipping. Got here 2 days early but still took 2 weeks\\nMMOGA is the best for unbelievable prices on games and software. Customer service is top shelf and the best online customer service on the web. Customer service wastes no time i helping customers and work feverishly to resolve issues. MMOGA is the best.\\nWhat a wonderful day!\\nWe were a group of 11 on a private tour to Mostar from Mlini and Dubrovnik.\\nThe bus was new and very comfortable.  A must for such a long day.\\nScenery was spectacular.  And Mostar was beautiful.  Made us want to visit again and spend more time.\\nBut, without a doubt, the highlight for us was the guides.  Jena (I\\'m sure I\\'m spelling that incorrectly) in the city was informative and gracious.\\nOur driver (Pero, I\\'m guessing) was friendly and extremely competent.\\nBut, the gold star, was Elena (spelling, yet again) was remarkable.  Fun, incredibly knowledgeable, patient with a group of crazy Canadians.\\nBu coincidence, we ran into her in Montenegro on another tour and she continued to help us out.\\nA long day, but a great day!\\nCheck it out!\\nThis is such a wonderful idea and product. I was very impressed with the customer service and great results.\\nI ordered the supplies on Wednesday and they were delivered to my door on Saturday.  What wonderful service!\\nI am very happy with the front rotors and pads I received from you. I beleive that your spot on with quality, price and shipping time.\\nSo convenient!  Same price I would pay at the local store, but instead, it arrives at my front door with free shipping!!\\nMy husband surprised me with a last minute ( like 4 days ahead), Mother\\'s Day getaway.  The unit we rented was AMAZING!  Even better in person than the pictures.  The rental was clean, décor was welcoming but stylish.  The location, once again, even better than the photos.  Will definitely be renting again!\\nI really like that i just know the prices shown are the lowest prices. Sometimes the layovers are too long.\\nInitial buying experience OK - but you keep recommending books that have ZERO relevance to anything i’ve previously ordered from you.\\nDon\\'t order from them. They don\\'t check the proof really well . They just skimmed through my order and didn\\'t find the misspelled word. Now my wedding invitations are all wrong and they should have caught it.\\nI had an problem with my domain registration so I contacted hostinger staffs for assistance and I have never done a better thing the issue was resolved within minutes I didn\\'t even remembered that I had a problem. Hostinger is the best web host with their professional staffs I would recommend them to anyone that\\'s looking for a great website hosting experience.\\nEasy to understand detailed info, smooth ordering sequence, was kept informed on order and delivery. Very quick install and back in business! Great!\\nI received order in a timely manner and the product was easy to use and exactly as ordered.\\nThey were everything I\\'ve read online I would used WallyPark again. Angela Watkins\\nIm a long standing loyal Swagbucks user! I earn real money and appreciate the opportunities it offers me. Thank You Swagbucks!\\nAs usual Thriftbook.com was an awesome experience. I use this site every time I order a book and I love it. I would not use any other book site.\\nRead the reviews to help set your expectations and understand what you\\'re getting.  We have had great experiences using VRBO.\\nDiscovered Seven Fathoms Rum on Grand Cayman Island this summer.  It is an awesome rum that is distilled in Georgetown.  Could not find it anywhere here in the States till I checked here.  The price is good and service was exceptional.  Will order again... Soon.\\nI love MightyNest! I have been a subscriber to their MightyFix monthly box for almost 2 years and in all that time, there has only been one item I did not use. (And I gave it to my brother who loved it!) Many of these products I now purchase regularly and I always buy from MightyNest. I love that I can add any items to my monthly subscription box for no additional shipping and customer service is always stellar. Plus, they donate a portion of my purchase to my son\\'s school!\\nThe service is quick, reasonable , dependable.    The company has an excellent selection and pricing beats any local store.  Plus, thanks to the web, they are open 24/7.\\nMy experience with Justfly.com has been moth & easy! Thank you justfly!!\\nAmanda was a pleasure to work with. She was very patient and friendly, and handled our quotation and artwork changes very professionally, and our order was processed quickly and accurately. Very pleased--would definitely work with USB Memory Direct again.\\nreally good value for money, told everybody who is going over to new york to buy one before hand,\\nMy driver did a great job helping me find his car at La Guardia in heavy traffic, in construction (is every airport in the world always under construction?!) and in the dark!  The dispatcher had not given specific directions of which door to use to find the driver (but I had asked, so she should have!) so he really helped a lot.\\nSo great! And it is the best!\\nI was surprised to come across a terrific selection of dog-themed items, particularly pillowcases.  I had \"Googled\" \"doggy pillowcase\" and was surprised to find them at CafePress.  Easy site to navigate and my order arrived sooner than I expected.\\nThis is the worst experience I’ve ever had.\\nI will no longer do business with Kohl’s. I ordered an item online that they delivered to an incorrect address and state. I had to call 7 separate times to find out after one month they no longer carry the item I ordered. Then I got the run around about my refund to my credit card and the gift card I also used.  Kohl’s must not be aware there are plenty of online websites that give superior service compared to them.  I will never torture myself again with any purchase from Kohl’s. Even after calling the corporate phone number twice I still never received a phone call back.\\nreliable products, good price and fast delivery\\nI needed to \"customize\" a package, and customer support was on top of it! They customized it for me and gave me a great deal!! I was referred by a friend and can\\'t wait to get everything in!\\nGood product, quick ,and excellent customer service....thank you\\nProfessional service. Kept me posted on where tow truck was and ETA. DRIVER was pleasant, polite, efficient.\\nVery quick process and then timely delivery of game tickets!  Thank you TicketCity!\\nLove the products, they arrived fast. Did not like the lack of available shipping options, and high shipping costs.\\nWe have always had top-notch service with TherapyNotes, without a doubt.\\nThe best prices, price matching, quick shipping, and always freebies thrown in with the order (shaker cup, magazine subscription, etc.).\\nThe stickers were in the envelope with the receipt however, the receipt transferred its ink onto the sticker and now the sticker has a dull film over the top of the numbers- Not very pleased.\\nI can\\'t believe something like this would have worked, but I\\'m writing this review from my unlocked phone. Thanks.\\nIts a great feeling when you order parts online and it is exactly what you described and shipping was prompt.  I love it when my only headache is the project i\\'m working on and not my supply house.  Thanks for being reliable.\\nTop ! Très facile\\nYou asked for honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve parked at the Premium garage for 4 years now, averaging 40 weeks per year. The garage location is phenomenal and convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that said:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. I\\'ve walked to the garage one 4 occasions when flying into Seattle after 7PM because the shuttle takes too long (15+ minutes).\\r\\n2. I prefer scanning my membership card to leave; for the last 2 months the machine has been charging me $3,491 dollars. Each time the attendant has needed to take my payment rather than me using the machine. My question is why the machine is still malfunctioning after 2 months when employees know of the problem?\\r\\n3. From time to time I\\'ve had to park in valet because the entire garage is full; driving to a separate, off-site, WallyPark is inconvenient once I\\'m at the Garage. I should not be given an attitude when asking for my normal pricing under those circumstances, but I am. Each time I\\'ve had to use free parking points to decrease my valet bill when the only reason I used valet was because the entire garage was full (including the roof where the card reader is inoperable). I\\'ve tried other garages, and if WallyPark employees can\\'t see past company policies in order to accommodate paying customers, then I will continue going elsewhere. \\r\\n4. I still haven\\'t heard a return phone call from the Garage General Manager after leaving a message over a year ago.\\r\\n4. Finally, only a small minority of the employees I\\'ve come across have been even close to friendly. I don\\'t have to use WallyPark; I would rather park in an uncovered lot further away and pay friendly, accommodating people than park at your nicer garage and deal with non-chalant attitudes and very poor customer service skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, I park in your garage roughly 40 weeks per year, 3 or 4 nights per week.\\nParm and Raghav were very helpful in getting my flight tickets to India. Very courteous and professional!\\nI give 1star because I can\\'t give 0. It\\'s the  worse company that I ever seem.  I suppose to receive a package today, and I was waiting the whole day and tracking the package when the person that supposed to bring it writes that they came and no one was here.  That was not true, I didn\\'t leave the house a second, I was with my phone the whole day.  They didn\\'t left any paper saying that they came,but  they write down that they came in the tracking information. I call twice and nobody seems to care about it. And the only answer was that I have to wait until the next day,  and they will deliver to a access point,  no even in my address.\\nAlways able to find what I need.  Prices are very reasonable\\nIf I could give a zero star (or, better yet... a MINUS rating) for Avas Flowers, I would!   \\n\\nMy cousin passed away and my family and I were unable to attend the out-of-state funeral.   In our stead, I wanted to order sympathy plants for his mother and widow, as well as flowers for the service.  \\n\\nI\\'ve ordered flowers many, MANY times before (usually with a different online floral service), but have NEVER had as upsetting, maddening or exasperating experience in my life!   In brief (yes - this is the SHORT version):\\n\\n* I called Ava\\'s Flowers on Saturday to order flowers and plants for my cousin\\'s funeral to be held Monday morning at 10:30 a.m.\\n\\n*  Guy #1 (who answered Saturday\\'s call) told me to call back on Sunday.  (???)\\n\\n* I called on Sunday and spoke with \\'Guy #2\\'.   I stressed that it was imperative that the plants/flowers were to be at the funeral home by/before 10 a.m. on Monday.\\n\\n*  Guy #2 put me on hold and claimed to be \"checking with the local florist\".  He then assured me that \"the local florist said they would open \\'extra early\\' on Monday to get the order ready and it is guaranteed to be at the funeral home before 10 a.m.\"\\n\\n* I reiterated that if there was ANY chance that the order wouldn\\'t be delivered in time for the funeral at 10:30 a.m. on Monday, then I didn\\'t want to place the order.  \\n\\n* Guy #2 GUARANTEED me that the order would arrive Monday morning  by/before 10 a.m. \\n\\n* I placed an order for two plants and one floral arrangement to be delivered to the funeral home Monday morning by/before 10 a.m.\\nThe total cost came to $208.18\\n\\n* Monday morning, I called the funeral home at 10 a.m. and asked if my flowers/plants had arrived.  They had not.\\n\\n* I went to my order confirmation e-mail and clicked on the \\'check delivery status\\' button.  A message came up that said my order was scheduled for delivery that day - and no other information was available at that time.\\n\\n* I called the phone number listed on my e-mail and went through a ridiculously long menu in an attempt to talk with a human.\\n\\n* Once I finally reached someone (a woman this time... I\\'ll call \\'Gal #1\\'),  I was asked to hold while they tried to contact the florist (I thought I was supposed to be talking with the florist in the first place)!   They couldn\\'t reach the florist - and then the line went dead.\\n\\n*  By this time, the funeral had already begun.   My phone rang and it was the same company, but this time I was speaking with a different woman who I\\'ll refer to as \\'Gal #2\\'.  In my frustration, I said I wanted to cancel the flowers (which, obviously, were not present at the funeral)... but still wanted the plants to go to the deceased\\'s mother and widow.  \\n\\n* I was flippantly told by Gal #2 that they were \\'sorry\\' and would refund the cost of the flowers.\\n\\n* The time was now a bit after 11 a.m. and I was extremely irritated.  What put me over the edge, though, was when Gal #2 said that she had talked with her supervisor about my horrible experience and that her supervisor was willing to give me \"the best compensation that they\\'ve ever extended to someone\":  a $20 in-store coupon.\\n\\n* That was IT!!!   Incredulously, I told her that she AND her supervisor must be drunk to think that I would EVER spend another penny with this company and, furthermore, that pitiful gesture was the final straw - so I canceled my ENTIRE order!\\n\\nI am overwhelmingly disgusted by this company who, by the way, is NOT a local florist in the area that I wanted flowers delivered to (which is exactly how they advertised themselves).  Sadly enough, based on what I\\'ve since read/discovered about this unreputable company, I\\'m not their first victim.  Understandably, I consider this entire rotten experience with Ava\\'s Flowers to be nothing short of a waste of time AND money - at best.   They have yet to refund my $208.18  - and the worst of it is that there were NO flowers and plants from my family and me at my cousin\\'s funeral.\\n\\nShame on them!\\n\\nFor the record, I contacted my credit card company and registered a dispute for the charge from Ava\\'s Flowers.  This company has earned every bit of their bad reputation and I cannot UNrecommend them enough!    Buyer beware!\\nThe came fast.  The ink worked as listed and over all a home run.  Priced right to boot\\nReasonable price, good products, wish they could ship orders out quickly. My last two orders were not shipped out 3 days after orders placed,  have to email or call  to remind\\nHired allows you to create a best portfolio that attracts many companies.

As the first two purchases, my item (ring) is quite beautiful!!  I am happy to recommend \"The Pearl Source\" to everyone!!  This company is such a great company to purchase your pearls!!  Their pearls are wonderful quality!!\\n******** EDIT: the same day I emailed thrift books to see if I could still return the book, they emailed me back and very efficiently handled the problem. I would recommend thriftbooks to anyone looking for a fun website to browse, and inexpensive books. ********\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shipping was extremely fast. I ordered two books and they arrived separately, but within days of each other. The only thing I didn\\'t like was that the description of one book stated it was a hardcover. It turned out to be a soft cover galley :( at $9.40, not a good price for a used paperback that hadn\\'t even been proofed yet. I would continue to order from this website, however, because shipping is fast and I can find what I want. I expect this was just a glitch.\\nfully satisfying\\nGood product and fast speed service (I had a deefective cartridge replacement with no questions asked in few days)\\nThis was a great gift for my husbands boss.

While I would not go out in public in leggings at my current size, I actually need this type products. It would be more encouraging to my workout dedication if I could bolster my self-esteem with a cute outfit. Sizes will get smaller as I go along, but it\\'s hard in the beginning. I was paired with outfits of xxs tops and 3x bottoms. Very frustrating. Also, sold out color choices could be more clearly identified.\\nCesar made my shopping at the furniture store pleasurable.

I would recommend this company to my friends and family.\\nYes,but shipping a little to high.\\nI bought 4 Lux thermostats in March. At the end of August we had a power outage and 2 quit working. Although they had a 3 year guarantee, Lux refused to replace them because they no longer made them. They actually told me to go to Lowe\\'s and buy 2 new ones.\\r\\nAfter considerable begging and pleading, Westside Wholesale agreed to replace them. They had already sold all of the model I had bought and sent replacements that were selling for $10 less than what I paid but had all the same features and better display.

Both times the clothing in the orders was shipped at different times. No big deal. But, both times I received emails stating one item had shipped and 8-10 days later a different item arrived without any notice. Most recently I  ordered two pairs of pants and some boots. Three weeks ago I got an email stating one pair of pants was shipped and the other ones and boots would d ship later. Two weeks ago got an email saying boots had shipped but it could take 8 working days to arrive. 10 working days later, no boots, but the other pants arrived, again without notice\\ni am very happy with thriftbooks   price, choices and quick shipping make thriftbooks great to do business with\\nThe site was easy to use.

What prompted the move was a lack of communication from my previous vendor. What made me choose ClearCare over the other platforms I was exploring was the fact that the system allows for my staff to be more self-sufficient, thus taking strain off my office. Before ClearCare, we were using multiple platforms for various purposes- one for scheduling, another for telephony, a website for charting visit notes, etc. The move to ClearCare has drastically cut down a lot of my time spent on administrative tasks. CC is also very responsive regarding inquiries and action items, and I love how they seek customer feedback on future planning and innovation.\\nWell the place that installed wasn\\'t to helpful to me, the unit that was put in my car doesn\\'t beep when it time to blow into the unit, I have to keep taking my eyes off the road to keep checking to see if the blow sign is lite, there was a few times when I almost had and accident by looking down to see if it\\'s time to blow into the unit, I texted the company about this problem but haven\\'t heard from them, other that that I have nothing else to say about intoxalock until they fix this problem,  I will keep on trying to get in contact with them.\\nHands down the fastest and cheapest ticket I\\'ve ever bought especially being last minute!!\\nWe had a great trip with Globus.

Never have I been disappointed when making changes or adding new equipment and needed a little insight to ensure quality performance. Yes, you can probably find cheaper products but, if you want quality equipment at a fair price, you can trust Security Camera Warehouse, knowing that the service will be there when you need it. For me, the quality of service far outweighs any savings in cheaper equipment!!\\nIt was clean and the staff were friendly.\\nThe day I went there were a lot of people so carts were limited.

It\\'s not your fault as that\\'s happened every time over the last few years. I\\'m guessing they use that excuse to save money by not delivering. Awesome service and pricing on your end so many THANKS, John\\nI found Vidarjewelry on Etsy the first week of March.  I found the perfect engagement ring for my soon to be fiancé and knew that I had to have it.  I contacted Roi and asked if it was possible to have the stone changed in the ring to an Aquamarine and sure enough it was!  I purchased the ring on March 1 and today, March 11, I received it!  The craftsmanship is stunning and the ring is perfect. Roi worked with me every step of the way from offering ways to size her without her knowing, to shipping options to just keeping me posted on the progress.  Roi was incredibly easy to work with and I could not recommend someone more!  His work is one of a kind and absoultey stunning.  On top of that, there was an appraisal of the ring with it and THE BOX HAS AN LED LIGHT IN IT!! As a theatre professional, that little detail makes me smile and laugh and appreciate the obvious pride he takes in his work.

We called roadside assistance once and they were helpful once we figured out that it was registered under my name as the renter. Also Outdoorsy was quick to reply to make changes to my booking even over the holidays.\\nThe Agents I talked to were very knowledgeable and informative about the Plans I asked about.

Many factors contribute to my rating, primarily search result relevance, convenience, and speed.The search tool was exceptional in all three aspects. I searched for \"savings account\" to see the best financial institutions nearby. Not only did the search tool return a gigantic list of banks, but also options that matched my expectations. There is a nice filter within the search tool, so I will get the best results. I can also switch from specific categories, such as CD/Savings, Checking, and Mortgages.

After several days I was advised that only the ballpoint would ship as the rest was out of stock - the remainder would be shipped upon receipt when they received their next shipment in seven days.  I called after 8 days and they said their order was delayed another week.  Surprised they didn\\'t email me as soon as they learned they didn\\'t receive their shipment.

Supplement Warehouse ships things fast even when it\\'s close to a holiday and I really haven\\'t found a better site for cheap supplements.\\nI took a chance and bought the Plush Soft because of the reviews on their customer service as well as their mattresses. Unfortunately, even this mattress was too firm for me and they were wonderful. They had the delivery service come and remove the mattress and refunded all but the initial delivery fee as expected. We are moving out of the country so we knew that if the mattress was not for me we would not be taking it with us. \\n\\nEvery other vendor could learn from this. Try the mattresses! It was very well made and in pristine condition. I used a mattress protector and I kept it covered with a clean protector for the few days it took the delivery service to come get it. I wish they had one soft enough for me. I looked at Mattress Firm and the softest one in the store was $3600 for just the king mattress. So we will tolerate our old mattress and get a new one when we get to our new country. So sorry I could not keep the mattress.

Delivered within the time frame too so very happy all round.\\nBeing new in an area is difficult.  HomeAdvisor helped in identifying reliable contractors.  To be honest not all of the suggested contractors had the best reputation when checking other reviewer(s).

Awesome! Thanks guys!\\nWhen it comes to purchasing items from Reeds, I\\'ve been very happy....as long as I purchase in the store.  I made an expensive purchase for Valentine\\'s online and was horribly disappointed.  My order arrived and fell apart right out of the box.  I was devastated.  Luckily, we were able to return it and exchange it at our local store.  I don\\'t think I will risk ordering anything else from Reed\\'s online.

I received a $100 voucher for a 12 pack of wine and looked further into who and what they are. I am so happy I did because I absolutely love Naked Wines.

I\\'ve gained 2 reliable contractors.  I\\'ve also had contractors start the job to find they don\\'t have the experience, bail the project for other jobs, be rude, leave the job unfinished.\\n  \\nAs a Business Analyst/Project Manager It would be good if Home Advisor could either provide an optional project management or tracking service or open the door to project managers to offer their services as an addition to projects.

Their website is chaotic nonsense. Wobetide you if forget your password!  I\\'m positive mine was correct, but the website insisted it wasn\\'t. I asked for a new password.

They informed me they in fact DID carry it. The salesperson on the phone, (J.P.), asked if I would mind telling him why I chose this brand of tire. I filled him in on the details, and he again asked if I would mind if he could suggest another tire brand. I informed him I didn\\'t mind, and he suggested Nexen tires. I told him I had never heard of them and he qualified his suggestion with a wide array of facts on this tire brand. I was impressed with his knowledge and told him I would take a chance and purchase the tires he suggested. He told me I had 30 days to make my mind up but was sure I would love them. I told J.P. I would be back in a couple of hours to pick the car up. Fifty-seven minutes later, I got a text informing me my car was ready! Four-wheel alignment included. When I picked my car up, J.P. was busy, so I didn\\'t have the chance to thank him and tell him I was impressed with the timing and service. After driving less than 1/8th mile, I was sold. These tires were MUCH more plush than my former tires. The service & price sold me on Town Fair tire. The quality and performance of the tire was the icing on the cake.\\nThey delivered on what they promised.  I could log on /off whenever I wanted. I liked the fact that they quizzed me after each section, so the material was fresh in my mind; and for the most part the final contained the material from the quizzes.  Even though no one likes to review this information I did learn a few things, especially about new laws.  I definitely recommend this class and even though I don\\'t expect to need it ever again, I would take it if I had to.\\nHave used Home Advisor for multiple home residence jobs (electrical, plumbing, home cleaning)... all professionals provided great service, follow up and no \"over-charging\", all jobs I felt were fair value for the time and service needed!\\nI now prefer HomeAway to AirBnB.

Well worth the 10 bucks.\\nHonest description of item and fast shipping....\\nIf the rate on Justfly is the same as the airline\\'s site, then I book because I get a $5.00 rebate from ebates.\\nI do not book with Justfly for the following reasons:\\n-Ordering Economy tickets which include assigned seats, but there is a service fee ONLY on Justfly\\'s site and not the airline\\'s site.  So I forgo the $5.00 ebate and save $30 just on assigned seating fee.\\n-I get to the point of actually confirming the order and it tells me the flights are $60 per ticket more just because.  This adds up especially when I was booking 3 tickets.  I ended up going on the airline\\'s site and ordering there for the original price.\\nGood.

When you get what appears to be a good match, you work things out with the sitter and pay through the site. The dogs are insured for any illness or injury that might occur while they are being cared for by a Rover sitter. Our experience with the sitter was excellent too.  If you can use the internet, you can use Rover.com.\\nVery easy process and my niece loved her gift!\\nThis is fun and challenging, the best part is my teenagers turn off the game system and we hang as a family for hours trying to figure out all the clues.

Five stars for sure!!\\nOn time. Perfect service\\nI was introduced to Simplilearn by my company. I was a bit skeptical because I wasnt sure how the online learning would be due to its lack of human interaction compared to that of the classroom versions. But I was wrong. They have a 24/7 support that can help you whenever you are stuck in a course. The details and dept of information of the courses give you a holistic view of the entire topic. You end up getting deep insights into the said topic. I took a course of Digitial Marketing Certified Associate. With a little background in Digital Marketing, I slowly realized that the information given was up to date. They have projects in place too which you can complete with friendly timelines post the completion of your course. The course agenda takes you through the right path from basics to slightly complicated to highly detailed information. The website is fairly fast and the videos load instantly and do not buffer. A great site to do you specialized e-learning.\\nvery pleased with the whole process from start to finish\\nI was very satisfied with the price of the product and the timeliness of receiving the product!\\nGreat experience with West Coast Shaving.

Office staff wonderful.\\nThank you!!\\nThe dress had a video preview, and it arrived a day earlier than expected! It was wonderful and my dress looks beautiful.\\nHORRIFIC and that\\'s putting it mildly. We arrived at 7pm and didn\\'t leave until 2am on New Year\\'s Eve. You have over 2000 cars parked on top of each other in various lots some marked some not, in no apparent order and on top of each other with the keys left in the car and the doors unlocked. You have no idea where any of these cars are parked. Management and many of your staff were very rude and basically could care less about all the families you left stranded. It was only because of one sympathetic employee that my car was found. It took us 20 minutes driving and walking up down several very poorly lit lots before I found my car. Some of the lots are not even paved and are covered in straw. A few of us as a last resort, called the police and when they arrived they said they come to your business for the same reason at least once a week. Your staff offered no explanation, no compensation. Whatever business model you are using, it does not work. Your greed will end up biting you in the butt. ANYONE THAT READS THIS,  DO NOT PARK YOUR CAR HERE. SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GO TO A REPUTABLE PARK AND FLY LOCATION.\\nService was great!\\nReceived part when I was supposed to,good part at a reasonable price.\\nWaiting in line to get on the Big Bus...at all the stops was the low point of the trip.

I applied for a car loan online, and received approval email about a week from then. I searched around different dealerships but ended up sticking with carmax. I found a 2016 Mazda3 sport which I love. Very low miles on it and I got free shipping to ship it from North Carolina. It took 5 days for them to ship my car and I bought it on the 7th day. All I paid was $305 for the down payment and roadloans took care of everything else. The process did not take very long at all. About 2 weeks for everything. To do the paperwork and carmax fueled up and cleaned the car, it took about 2hr 30min. Great experience. I would definitely reccomend to someone else.\\nFirst time buyer, never got item delivered. \\r\\nDid not refund full amount\\r\\nWorst customer service, thanks to Jason Kampinga.\\r\\nPersonally never will or recommend anyone to buy Onnit product.\\r\\nCame with a recommendation, surprised, shocked and very disappointed.\\ngreat experience\\nadored using priceline.

Payment was prompt.\\nListed three businesses and customer reviews and ratings which helped me make a decision on what company to hire.\\nIt was a remarkable experience\\nWe had good seats, But from our seats our view was obstructed to second base and center field.

From signing up to getting gigs it was a wonderful experience.  I love the fact that it is international and their customer service by passes all customer service I have encountered in a long long time.

Thank you TrustedHousesitters you are the best.\\nThe team members are extremely nice and helpfull. I never have to weight long.  I go to different locations and I would recommend every one of them\\nReceived the brass holiday candle carousel and it was quite a bit more delicate than I thought it might be. Not bad but it should be stated that the product is fragile. There was a little bent edge on one of the angels that was fairly easily straightened out by hand. Other than that, product was delivered in a timely manner and somewhat met expectations.\\nAll i can say is that they did what they said they would do.\\nWhen I\\'m looking for books to purchase, ThriftBooks is my first stop.  Not only is a used book the planet-friendly choice, but my PayPal balance appreciates the prices too.  The website is easy to use, nice to look at, and my purchases are on their way the next day.\\nI would highly reccomend  the products from this company due to their fair prices,their teaching of their products and the quick service.

She makes another order for the items I origially order, since waiting for their return to HDIS would have been an intolerable delay. She has it shipped next day Air with UPS, a $53.00 cost.

On some products the sizing can be off, so just be cautious ordering and look at the sizes. What makes me give it four stars is the customer service. It\\'s not that it\\'s bad necessarily, they just make it really difficult to get out of the VIP services. The only reason I have continued ordering is because I inevitably forget the skip the month and have a credit. I never want to cancel my account until I use that credit. I have called to cancel twice, but as previously mentioned I didn\\'t want to lose the credit that I already paid for.

I didn\\'t get free shipping, but wanted the bulbs enough to pay the shipping and handling charges.  I am happy with my purchase and my plants thank you.\\nI am highly upset and frustrated at this point. I called square trade to get repairs done to my Iphone 7 that i purchased of purchasing power on Sept 8, 2017... the person who assisted me with my claim was very polite and helpful. He filed my claim and sent me the shipping label and told me it would be better if i sent my phone in on Monday so that i can have my phone by Wednesday per the overnight shipping that he stated was so easy and convenient.  The shipping instructions was plain and simple and i followed them and mailed my phone off on Sept 11th. I received and email stating that my phone was shipped and that it was received on Tues Sept 11 @1000am. So going off the gentleman i spoke to i figured my phone will be fixed that day and shipped to me that night to be received on Wednesday. I didn\\'t receive and update and so i contacted square trade for an update. The gentleman stated that yes the phone is in the process of repairs and i should receive my phone on Thursday. i was ok with a day delay. Thursday comes and i still have not receive an update on the phone. Friday comes and i contact again. The young lady states that an email was sent to me to turn of find my iphone and that I need to respond to email in order to start repairs. By now i am livid because none of this was communicated to me and from my understanding and the last conversation i had was that my phone was getting repaired. In the instructions before sending i should have been instructed to turn off find my iphone before shipping but i wasn\\'t. And also each time i mad contact i shouldn\\'t have been told different instructions and updates. Its is now Monday and contact them again in regards to my claim, the teller states that they received the confirmation in regards to my phone and will start repairs today and i will receive a confirmation withing 24/48hours. What was supposed to be a 2-3 day thing turned into a whole week. I am a mother with two young children and to be without a phone for a week is ridiculous especially when most companies don\\'t give out loaner phones which in my case my service doesn\\'t. I pay for the coverage so that this kind of thing doesn\\'t happen and i thought i was going to be guaranteed that my phone would be back 2-3 days flat. The tellers were all telling me different things and now i have to wait and extra maybe 24 to 48 hours to get an update and maybe another few days before i actually get my phone sent back to me fixed. A full 8 days and my phone isn\\'t repaired and sent back to me.

Will definitely be shopping here again and again! \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks!!\\nFantastic hotel used through Gala Hotels and easy to book. Only issue was it wasn\\'t the room I had booked online. I had rung Gala Hotels head office specifically to double check that upon our arrival we had a twin double but when we arrived at the hotel it was a double bed not a twin. Bit disappointing however The Hotel were fantastic and soon sorted it so wasn\\'t a problem.

This was the smoothest, most relaxed and organized adventure we\\'ve ever experienced.

Robot got my order dead WRONG, then it took 4 phone calls to get it corrected.  We will see results after billing and receipt of goods.\\nLanded around 1am at O\\'hare. After following the instructions on the slip and texting WallyPark (I received a response), it took them over an hour to come and get us. We called multiple times and received a not-so-polite response from the woman at the front desk. Then, they wanted to charge us an extra hour when it was their fault that our car was there for an extra hour.\\nI thought the price was too good to be true . Upon placing order price was exactly what was mentioned with no shipping or tax. I thought maybe the item would be a knock off. When received I was truly surprised . It was a true otter box cover. Shipping took about a week which was great. I am truly pleased and satisfied with my purchase. Will definitely continue to shop with A4C and I highly recommend everyone to shop  AND buy from them. Thank for great pricing and quality merchandise 😀\\nGreat packaging\\nThe camera package I bought dropped in price by $50 two days after I made my purchase, but they wouldn\\'t offer any type of refund or price-match. Which is clearly stated under their policies, so they did nothing wrong. However, it makes me wary of future purchases.\\n\\nOn the plus side, it was still a nice package price; and the various items arrived quite quickly and safely.\\nI bought a really cute necklace for my daughter with her and her boyfriends names on it. She really loved it. It did break after a couple months, but i have to say when I contacted customer service, they quickly replaced it with a brand new one with no cost to us! I would def buy from them again especially knowing that they are willing to stand by their jewelry if it  breaks!\\nGreat deals good product\\nSkinstore used to be my go-to for products with its great deals and customer service. They were taken over by another company based in the UK in recent years, and since then, the customer service/communication has been appalling. \\n\\nLast year, I ordered a product that took about a month to arrive with no communication about the delay from Skinstore. When the product finally arrived, it wasn\\'t the one I ordered, nor was there was anything written on the box to indicate that it was from Skinstore. There was no invoice or anything written inside that said Skinstore. Just a random product. I was scared to open it in fact, and when I tried to communicate with Skinstore, I received automated messages in return. No one picked up the customer service phoneline even though it was well within the listed hours. I didn\\'t understand why I was trying so hard to reach them when I wasn\\'t even sure this random product was from Skinstore. It took another few weeks to resolve this issue because the web interface wouldn\\'t allow for attached images. To skip ahead in this process, I was offered $5 off or something ridiculous for a 2 month drawn out process.\\n\\nNever again will I order from this company.\\nAlways a fast and secure delivery\\nWe\\'ve used BookIt.com many times in the past ten years and never been disappointed.

It gives the opportunity to see what others reviews are of places to visit, stay, and sightsee when on vacations.  It allows you to sort of know the place in advance before booking.  Great idea,  I love it.  \\r\\nI would highly recommend this site to anyone.\\nLooked at several different jack manufacturers and decided on Barker, primarily because they are built in USA{probably with foreign pieces}.  Dyer\\'s had a good price and it was in stock, so I purchased from them.  Fast shipping, am pleased with the complete transaction!\\nParts were delivered on time and as promised.

Give that girl a raise and take care of her, more businesses need more of her, she was excellent and made me laugh, I almost offered her a job working in property management that\\'s how good she was, she is smart knows her job and has excellent customer service, even being left alone on a very busy Saturday, she\\'s wonderful and If I could give her a job, I AM!!!\\nIt was a stressful evening for everyone being evacuated from Key West.

Low and behold, keep looking and found a $84.00 per night room at the Best Western Dulles that just blew my mind.  What a perfect find!  Saved a ton of money, so it pays to keep looking!\\nI bought several products & reviewing each one individually. See below.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo jerk - I ordered one pack of the buffalo jerk to try it out before buying a whole box and this is one the best jerkies I\\'ve had. It\\'s very tender, very tasty and not too sweet. It does have a slight hint of sweetness but not where it takes away from the jerk flavor. I loved it so much I ordered a box. I had been looking for a nice healthy snack & excited I found this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHemp Force Protein Bar - Awesome protein bar! The bar has a really nice texture, very satisfying and I just love the healthy ingredients. It\\'s nice to have tasty healthy option. I don\\'t mind paying a high price for an outstanding product. All the ones I\\'ve had before by other companies have been loaded with sugar. \\r\\n\\r\\nT + Total Strength - I got this product a few weeks ago & am really loving the results. I feel like I can push myself harder than before. I work two job & sometimes feel worn out to workout. I\\'ve used this as a pick me up to get me going. I\\'ve tried other products alike & most times it\\'s loaded with sugar and or made from synthetic ingredients where I breakout. I was initially hesitate about ordering until I found out about their return policy. It gave me the courage to purchase as I\\'ve wasted money on products before because of the break outs & couldn\\'t return them. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnnit 180 -The first day I tried this product I had half of a pack. I felt a slight bit of alertness, focus, and just a general good vibe. The second time, I increased my dose to 3/4 of the pack & those feelings increased.

THANK YOU for a painless and positive experience.\\nI will never do business with Electronic Express again. I bought a washer and set up for the delivery 3 weeks out. When I received the email about my delivery I was scheduled between  6 & 9 pm. I was surprised since I had scheduled so far out. On delivery day I hadn’t heard anything from them. I called the store at 8:50 pm and they said it would be 10:10 pm before they would be coming. I told them that would be to late. The next morning I called and it was going to be another week before they could get me back in the schedule. After talking to the manager  he said there was nothing he could do because I declined the delivery. I told them that was to late to be delivering on a week night. I don’t want to do business with anyone not concerned with my time. I went and got my money back and went somewhere else. I had my washer delivered at a normal hour.\\nSecond bed of this type that we\\'ve ordered.  Hoped for earlier delivery!!!  Our house flooded.

I appreciate the explanation\\r\\nand hope when I have tires done again something like bent rims will not be\\r\\noverlooked or missed.\\r\\nThanks,\\r\\nEd Nolan\\nI love having my pets\\' food delivered to my door; I don\\'t have to carry heavy cartons or make frequent trips to the pet shop.

It\\'s straightforward to use and there\\'s rapid support for any queries. We\\'ve not needed to use any other site as there\\'s always lots of options available.\\nGreat price compared with vet prices\\nI don\\'t like to leave negative reviews but I feel it is necessary to share the bad experience I have had from One.com - particularly after attempting a resolution and instead receiving a confrontational exchange from one of the (so-called) managers on the live chat desk. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will try and keep my story brief but basically I set up a website for a friend a while ago for her new company. A little while after setting it up, we both attempted to request that the ownership information was changed into her name and company name - mainly for accounting purposes. However, I kept receiving the bills and was sent a couple of reminders, including interest incurred. Upon attempting to contact One.com by email (you can only do this online, so no telephone option), I did not hear anything back to confirm my previous requests had been received to change ownership. Instead, today I received an email from a debt collection company demanding the account is settled within 7 days. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter speaking to a very helpful person at Intrum Justitia Ireland Ltd. debt collectors, I was advised to speak to One.com to resolve, via their Live Help Desk (as the best option) to try and resolve and to have the collection order rescinded, considering the circumstances. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, after a protracted conversation with one team member, which transpired that One.com only changed the domain name registration, not the webspace registration, I requested the case was reviewed by a manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey in no uncertain terms told me that because they had apparently sent me a \\'handover\\' form, they would not be willing to either resend the form or set up the change of ownership (despite me not receiving such a form) and instead I would have to settle the account with the debt collectors, because otherwise \"they would have to burden any costs of withdrawing\" their claim to the debt collectors. Upon challenging this further, I was met with very curt, confrontational responses from the manager who offered no willingness to help or resolve the matter - instead effectively arguing with me in a live chat exchange - to the extent where they were suggesting by offering me a sent date and time for the link they apparently sent me for the handover form (which I didn\\'t receive), was proof that I had received and read the changeover form:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have given you the date and time. Send it to your mail service provider... And they can check the logs. That will be the proof\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I retorted, if I had received and read the changeover form I would have actioned it, which meant I would not have been having the conversation with him in the first place. So, instead of resending the form, or offering to process the exchange of ownership as previously requested, I was told to settle the account with the debt collectors, including interest incurred, because there was nothing else they could do (or were willing to do, despite having the ability to do so) \\r\\n\\r\\nI am incredulous to say the least. I have never experienced such poor, impersonal and unprofessional service from a service provider. For the record, during the exchange I mentioned to the manager (after giving several opportunities to put things right) that I would be sharing my experience on Trustpilot. He responded by saying that I would be \"defaming their name on unfounded grounds\". Well, I can assure you my experience is very real. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have several companies, 3 of which are already registered with One.com. I will be cancelling all of the subscriptions to their service and would prefer to take my business elsewhere. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not my place to say to avoid One.com but I just hope if you do use them, that you experience much better service than I have.\\nWe Florida residents have given the gift of Honeybells to four families in the North for the past three years.

Ordered contacts on November 22 and still haven\\'t received them and it\\'s December 7th. When I contacted tech support the first time they said they would call me the next day at a scheduled time.

Still waiting...\\nexcellent and fast service, good prices\\nDue to serious business losses this year I maxed out credit cards, and had to turn to ClearOne for debt consolidation.

Still waiting to see the results.\\nI use Economy Car Rentals twice a year when i go to Cyprus. Good price and never a problem - would not change. Another reason i like them is that when i pick the car up there is usually a full tank of petrol. When i take it back i just have to make sure it has the same amount of petrol in as when i picked it up. Other car rental companies give you the car and charge you for the petrol in the car on receipt (not the same price as the current cost of petrol) and then when you take it back you either drive back on fumes or leave them with extra petrol you have put in and it costs you both times - on top of the car rental itself\\nWe took the bus from RI to NYC.  The bus was waiting for us when we arrived and it appeared new.  It was clean and comfortable.\\r\\nThe drop-off was at 30th and 9th.  We walked to World Trade Center site.

When I arrived, I was told there were no more covered valet parking spots. That was my first strike. The attendant at WallyPark told me to sit and wait inside for the next shuttle. He said he would let me know when the shuttle was ready. I took a seat, and began watching the news. I decided to check to see why the wait was so long. As I did that, I saw a shuttle pulling off from in front. I was obviously annoyed. I decided to watch for the next shuttle myself. The attendant didn\\'t even come get me when the second one came around. I just walked out to the shuttle myself. My flight was cancelled and I had to come back in the morning. Thankfully, I was not charged for the 3 hours my car was parked at WallyPark.

If you offer an item for a specific price....make sure it is that price and not higher with a bunch of add-ons.  I am busy and don\\'t have time to play games.  We also ordered the assortment of colors.  We only received 2 colors.  We were told that it was because that was the way they were randomly packaged.....well, we received one box of red and one box of black.  There is nothing random about it.  They did send us 20 more of a different color at no cost, but I would rather not waste time calling them.\\nTrustedHousesitters.com has been our go-to housesitting website.

My only regret is that with all the venting these helmets are cold in the winter and I had trouble fogging. There is a fog screen available with breath box. I didn\\'t get a chance to use it on my old Star before it was road rashed, but I\\'m hoping it will fit this helmet as well.\\nRequested 5 free samples. These arrived within a few days and allowed me to pare my choices down to two. I will finalize my choice soon but know that the samples made my decision very easy! Wonderful way to do business. These people are customer-oriented in word and action!\\nI wanted to pay using PayPal but was unable to have it work. Otherwise booking was painless.\\nMerchandise came sooner than expected. Will definitely order from ur company again. Thank u\\nJelesa was super helpful and very explanatory. It was one of the easiest experiences ever.\\nI\\'ve never rented a storage unit before. This year I have experienced 2 different types.  My friend rented one at the same time I did at another location from a different company.   I have learned much.   I feel secure here.  I have nothing of real value, but I needed space and I didn\\'t want an outdoor unit.   Bugs or mice NOT destroying my belongings seemed like a priority for me.  I have many items in large containers but some things are too large to protect completely.  \\r\\nMy friend has an outdoor drive up unit, she speaks of the chance of mice getting in.  We packed hers for an upcoming move.  She has a lot of important items in the unit.  I felt uneasy, she was matter of fact about it.  I never would have believed how nice Lifestorage was if I had not been there Myself.  It is above my expectations.  I have had family come along to help me with large items and everyone has been impressed.  This Harwood Heights location has been a gift to me.  I am glad I found it.  Other wise Id be in a crammed house trying to cope during transition.\\nI ordered three crocks and 1 soup bowl that are supposed to be personalized--I was told they are all out of stock--would have liked to have had them for X-mas\\nBest product on the market and they\\'re still improving it.\\neverything was perfect....\\nDelivery was flawless.

Thanks!\\nexcellent.....\\nI purchased 6 e-giftcards for Bed Bath & Beyond. They were for varying amounts, but the listings were otherwise identical. Three of them worked on the BB&B website, the other three would produce errors. After several emails and phone calls to GiftCards.com, BB&B, and Google (since they are a \"Google trusted site\"), I found out that the ones that were causing errors were merchandise credits, which cannot be used on BB&B\\'s website. The listing did not indicate this, and I would not have purchased them otherwise, as it is not convenient for me to go to BB&B store. GiftCards.com was unresponsive to my emails, rude to me on the phone, and the issue was not resolved to my satisfaction. Will never use again; not worth it for a 5-10% discount.\\nVery good person and very professional  this kind of personnel shall lead to highest horizon in customer satisfaction and give your organization more business.  Nitin. Vaidya. Piscataway,   N. J.\\nI found the perfect gift card, with a picture on it that would make my son smile. He thought it was funny, as I intended. Easy to use website and all kinds of images that anyone could use. Quick check out, low fees and fast delivery (even by snail mail). Will definitely use again!\\nThe shipping took 10 days from when I ordered the item to arrive and when it arrived the writing looked a little pixelated. It will do because it\\'s a gift and the person I\\'m giving it to is not a detail person, but for $15 I expect a little better quality. Overall, it was fine.\\nI was looking for source of sapphires that was from a conflict free region and found this company. I was pleasantly surprised to find an amazing collection of Montana Sapphires that fit the cut and color my SO wanted.

She researched the bulbs I needed which apparently were discontinued. She found the\\r\\nequivalent bulb,base and wattage. A painless experience.\\nThis product arrived way quicker than expected so happy I didn\\'t order off of any other site. Products arrived blanketed by foam peanuts and wrapped well in a nice box just way more than I expected. You would think your ordering a 3000 dollar watch or something. Nice sample products as well.  Which def means something to me that you care enough to invest in yourself as a company and actually send them out to customers. Overall wonderful experience with this site. I used to buy in the mall near my house but vender moved further away so no I\\'m happy I found an even better way to get the product I really like. Thank you!\\nI loved my item! It came very quickly and it was as advertised! I\\'ll be referring this site to as many people as possible and I\\'ll be purchasing more!❤️\\nI\\'ve only just planted my two pink lady apple trees, so have no idea of what the end result will be.  But, the shipment was sent timely and were very large, healthy trees.  They were packaged very securely.  The price was very comparable and they offered different sizes....not just the tiny sizes that you usually get with online orders.....hopefully, the trees will be just as great as the shipping experience was.

I can tap on your vast job resouces. Your job leads is exceptionally on point on my job target. I appreciate all that you do to make my job search easy and stress free.\\nThis review is solely on the booking experience. I tried to book a place and was then told the place wouldn\\'t accept one night reservations and they tried to intimidate me into staying more nights. Absolutely ridiculous. They should state that they don\\'t take one night reservations on their site instead of saying it is available for any number of nights.\\ncar and service excellent.  Additional insurance very expensive\\nTyler was a great help,the home was well cared for and clean.

A couple of months later, I was searching for other books I really wanted to read, but trying to save money, I wasn\\'t sure if I could justify spending that much money on books. Then my mom reminded me of Thrift Books and the books came in the condition they said they were in and I\\'m super happy!\\nI appreciated the courteous and respectful manner the representative handle my discrepancy as far as which airport I wanted to fly out of.\\nI can buy the same items that I can buy in the stores but only less expensive!\\nI was pleasantly surprised when my package arrived a day early.

The canned salmon and tuna are exceptional as are the pork products - I\\'ve so far tried brats and breakfast sausage.\\n\\nCustomer Service goes out of their way if I need help.  I like FedEx for my food shipments and customer service tagged my account so that all shipments ship via FedEx and I don\\'t have to worry about it.\\n\\nI cannot think of anything negative and I know from reviews that Vital Choice wants happy customers and will respond if there is an issue.\\nI need to send this shirt back.

The staff there at Drive Time were friendly, courteous, and attentive to my needs as a potential customer.  I am impressed with the refer a friend program and will be referring people to Drive Time to take advantage of having my payments made for referring a buying customer.  I want to especially thank my salesman and manager Lamont at the Fairfield store in Cincinnati, Ohio for being so patient and courteous with me :)\\nI ordered $100 plus in candy never received it Bern fighting with candy warehouse for a refund\\nI ordered and paid Wireless In-ear head phone but wired item delivered.\\nCrystal was amazing!!

Thank you, Crystal!\\nThank you for helping me in my time of need\\nReceived many promises during the initial phone call, but never received the email documenting these promises (as I was told would happen).  Much confusing number juggling during the installation .  Now I\\'m receiving emails from the \"Funding Resolution Department\" asking me to sign another contract for an increased monthly rate.  Not a good way to do business.   About the apps - below average . I have two motion detectors.  The web app shows both, the mobile app shows one.  Never heard of an alarm system that could not send \"arm\" and \"disarm\" notifications.  Now I have one.  My first alarm system in the mid 90\\'s send a message to my pager!  Remember those?  The system itself is adequate.\\nThis is the best ever foreign currency exchange,money transfer ever ,\\nUAE exchange is one in a million\\nThe experience was outstanding, found the right prices and the perfect flight for my trip.

I made the decision to switch all my domains from the other guy and come here.  All to save a couple bucks.  Big mistake.  My bad.  This hosting company is awful from the top down.  Nobody knows how to fix the even the most basic issues like billing.  You send them an email.  No response.  Then you call.  They place you on hold.  And explain in great detail the problem and they send you to another.  There help thingy on their web site is so out of date is not funny.  db operate on mysqli functionally which has been around FOR TWO YEARS!!!.  They don\\'t not have correct or current software to process this code.\\r\\n  Hey, if you have like one little site you might be OK.  But I truly don\\'t think they can handle even just one hosted domain.  The staff on the phone doesn\\'t even know how to work there own system!!.   It\\'s like the lights in the entire building got turned off and they\\'re just sitting in the dark.  Ummm.  OK,  there are plenty of hosting companies  out there that could serve your needs more effective other than H.G.  don\\'t think your gonna save money with these guys.  You will not.  \\r\\nI do not recommend H.G. \\r\\nI will be moving my domains from there server.\\r\\nGood luck\\nOur organization has been doing business with Crystal Images for a while now and we always receive superior service.\\nI ordered a few times with Pureformulas.

I can say I\\'m happy with my shopping with PureFormulas.\\nMy painting was beautiful- it accurately portrays my Black Lab Cleo. It looks so great on my bedroom wall- I had it framed to match my bedroom furniture.\\nI will reorder my ink from them everytime...speedy delivery awesome price and ink works great\\nAll I can say I would recommend it to anyone. I\\'m from Australia and wanted to send a baked gift to my love over in USA for his birthday. It was worth it, considering if I sent a cake from here wouldn\\'t have made it in good condition. \\r\\nI was worried the cake could possibly melt and I messaged customer service, I got reassured it\\'ll be fine because it\\'s the cake they send to soldiers that are deployed.\\r\\nThank you, I am one happy customer :)\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. Coincidentally, the cake was delivered to him as he was about to leave his house... smooth :D\\nFast, convenient,  great pricing, polite reps. An overall excellent experience.

Great prices and tons of choices.\\nGreat product, excellent customer service.\\nthey follow thru with all that they say.its fast and easy\\nI have bought about £100 worth of bits from them which all worked. You have to know how the website works. The stuff from the UK warehouse had cheap postage and came withing a week. But the stuff from China and Hong Kong took much longer and had quite expensive postage. You don\\'t know what the postage is going to be until you put the order through.\\n\\nLike the other hobby suppliers from China I have used, their items have high spec for the prices, but the instructions and data on them are poor. However, Hobbyking provides the ability for anybody to upload helpful notes and even videos on their items. I found this extremely useful. As Hobbyking seems to sell a lot of bits I have found a number of useful utubes demonstrating their bits and pieces.\\nLove this site, has many great brands to be healthy.

They were in good condition. I did have a little problem with tracking two of the books(online tracking), but overall, it was a very good experience.\\nAwful company, I waited 30 min for a pick up that never happened and was charged twice. Disgraceful. This company should be closed down. They just after your money, thieving scum bags😡\\nJackThreads has a great collection and I got a pair of Levis from them. It was well under the original price. Only problem is that it took about a week longer than I had expected. Great overall experience though.\\nThis company is a SCAM!!!! Do not use!!!!!\\nThey booked the wrong hotel for me and when I got the confirmation email and noticed the address was incorrect they refused to transfer to correct hotel or refund my money.  Also, I noticed imediatly after booking and room was scheduled a month out. They lead me to believe I was speaking directly to the hotel I was trying to book. SCAM ALERT!!!!!!\\nAlways enjoy the shopping at Yamibuy\\nThank you . Awesome service\\nThriftbook.com is the ONLY place I buy my books from. If they don\\'t have the book I\\'m looking for I just simply wait. They now have an app that makes my shopping more convenient. Along with a great rewards program. Not to mention free shipping. If your looking for a great reliable company, look no further than Thriftbooks.\\nIt was an excellent experience shopping with this company. My friend was hurry to get a Hamilton watch in 4 days and he was leaving the country. Bobby helped me to get one and ship it to me by the overnight shipping.

There\\'s a great selection of books and they come quickly and I love free shipping if you spend $10 which never is a problem to do.\\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! I have been nothing but disappointed in every aspect of service !! I had several complications in getting a unit- the first one was not the right size/ the second was already full and had a RED lock in it. The agent gave me a free month due to all of the issues, however when that month came they billed me and charged me a late fee !! I spoke with a manager and they said that employee didn\\'t have the authority to give me a free month- so I had to pay in full. THEN I called to pay the August bill and explained that we were moving the contents out on the 11th- I still had to pay the FULL MONTH\\'S RENT!! No pro rating...well...they pro rated me for the end of April and charged me for those days...GRRRRRRRR !! PLEASE AVOID THEM !! There are plenty of other good storage companies in Ankeny- dont make the same mistake I did 🙄\\nI have had a lot of success with dealing with this company.  Their prices are fair and the shipping is usually free.  My 4 dogs and 4 cats enjoy your products everyday.\\nAnthony Hall always explains my questions throughly and is interested\\nwhat I have purchased and what metal I didn\\'t have yet. He calls every\\nfew months and I appreciate that because it reminds me I still need a little\\nmore of precious metals.

Plus rewards given with each purchase!\\nThe purchase and check out process was easy. It was exactly what my son wanted for Christmas. We purchased one box just to see the quality. My son said it was a great value. Going to log back into website and sign him up for a 6 month subscription.\\nWe ordered a Liquid CPU Cooler, we asked for the 110 and we received the 100 (to give you an idea, I think these are about £20 cheaper). Nathan apologised and told me to send back and he would refund the postage.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did everything correctly (and they are VERY BAD with communication, emails or phone, rarely respond, I usually have to threaten then with Trading Standards for get any response from AQA Labs).\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually got a refund after several emails, messages and the threat of TS - but no refund for the £11 return postage (why should I have to accept/pay for this when this is their error for sending/not having the wrong product?). Some story about the supplier not sending us the right product - but yet they couldn\\'t just send me the correct one - seems a bit fishy to me. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo basically - AVOID.\\nI travel a lot - in and out of the US - so I stay on top of travel web sites.  it seems like I hear about a new one every few weeks.  I do check them out but I almost always come back to Priceline. I used to do Name Your Own Deal a lot.  But now I find Express Deals a whole lot easier, faster and less frustrating.\\nI love the price and the clothes! Everything that I have ever purchased has been excellent!!! I only wish they had more coupon/promo codes. Will totally do business with ModDeals again!\\nPleasant enough hotel, but spoilt by 8 euro charge to park my car--sheer profiteering!\\nAte out that night rather than spend any more money at your hotel.\\nMy order of two books arrived as expected in the condition advertised.

Especially if you want your taxes to be done correctly and to receive the maximum amount for your return.  I personally had a mini crisis and they were able to assist me and get my taxes done correctly.  Thanks for all the help that I receive.  See you next year !\\nIt was an awesome purchase experience. The selection is vast and once you place your order and receive your confirmation then all you have to do is await the deliver of your package\\nI made my bookings through RussianTrains.com which was easy and straightforward. I received an email re a delay in issuing tickets and after checking the website found the train we booked was unavailable. After contacting Customer Service they advised to book the train listed to ensure my I reached my destination as they didn\\'t know whether the original train would be rescheduled. There was a price difference and after becoming aware of this I again contacted Customer Service and was immediately refunded the difference. Customer Service is outstanding and always contacted me within 24 hours of a query. Would certainly recommend booking through their website.\\nAny glitches that I had that were unique to my website were handled quickly and explained to me in a manner that I could easily understand.\\nThe process was easier than friend\\'s who went through a different lender. The to-do list let\\'s you know all at once what is needed not piece meal as they go through the process. Nick S. and Mike H. we\\'re helpful and quick to respond to questions. Veterans United made purchasing our new home quick and easy.\\nSeems that item are often miss graded. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome sellers are willing to work with you and others blame you for their mistakes. \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscogs seem to take the easier route and just side with the seller opposed to working the issues out. \\r\\n\\r\\nGood when no issues arise but that seems to be few and far between.\\nOrdered shirt, it was mailed fairly quick. It is a present. Looks good\\nI have used Postsnap on several occasions now and I am very impresssd with the quality of their product and their service. The website is very easy to use and the cards are usually posted within 24-48 hrs. In this time of text, emails, twitter etc, people rarely receive things through the mail so the recipients of the cards have been thrilled to receive them. The thing I especially love is its no inconvenience to me. No sorting through postcards, no finding a post office or letterbox, no buying stamps. I can sit on the beach sipping a pina colada, whilst going online to Postsnap.  Choose the card, upload my chosen photos, write a few words click send. The price includes the postage and, because the cards are printed and posted in the UK, they arrive within more or less the next day. Perfect!\\nI\\'ve used cafepress for a few personalized gifts now (Father\\'s day, baby shower, etc.) and have found them to be high quality items with great customer service. One gift we ordered was time sensitive and when I contacted cafepress because the order didn\\'t arrive as expected, they quickly shipped a replacement, no questions asked (it ended up being a usps error- delivered to the wrong address). Prices are already reasonable and I can usually find a coupon online too. Overall very pleased!\\nTo Whom It May Concern;  I have only been researching through Ancestry for a year or so but even in that time I have been impressed with the way the system smoothly integrates new information and assists one to move on. The few requests I have made have been dealt with efficiently, with respect, and there is no problem if one wishes to have a \\'time out\\' occasionally. Sincerely, John Morris\\nGaurav Lohat provided us  a good itinerary...\\nCustomer service completely failed and lack of meaningful options to find out a sale status led to an ordered being cancelled . When a real person was finally reached , this person didn\\'t give two cents about it . Amazon will put you guys under\\nI went with SquareTrade because they allow repairs to be done at the Apple Store. Anyone who has used aftermarket parts on Apple products know they are sub-par and break easily. So my first claim at SquareTrade and they refused to cover my repair at an Apple Store.\\n\\nI called their sales line again to pretend I needed to cover my iPad and they said I absolutely can repair it at an Apple Store. Got transferred over again and they refused again. Managers refused as well. So I had to lose my iPad that I use every day and use it to fly as a pilot for an entire week when I could have walked down the block to an Apple Store and got it repaired the same day with OEM parts. Now my iPad has aftermarket parts with lower quality. \\n\\nSquareTrade Lies!!!  Will never use them again.\\nThe signs we ordered for our new office are very sturdy as well as attractive.  A nice product at a really good price.\\nThis is the site to buy gold and silver from.  I have used others but they are prompt and secure and I will buy from them in the future.\\nEveryone...from drop off of the car to pick up, drivers, etc. Unbelievable customer service, helpful. If you have your paperwork ready and follow pick up instructions...you are golden!!\\nHaven\\'t received my order that was placed 2 weeks ago.\\nI use priceline a few times a week. I always compare priceline to other websites and priceline always comes out the best deal.\\nSuper! quick and responsive. all across the atlantic!\\nThis was very easy to do and easy to use.\\nService and selection was very good. Staff helpful without being pushy. As a big man 6\\'3, 300lbs, with wide shoulders, long arms even for my height, and thick legs shopping can be hard at times especially for clothes that are in style. The one issue, one that has continued after the  name change of your store, I believe is an unfair mark up of prices. The practice is one that takes advantage of mine and others\\' body types. Yes some of us are overweight, but for myself even if I possessed less then 10% body fat I would still have to shop at stores like DXL. The price markup clearly takes advantage of our situation.\\nThe food is excellent and the recipes have all been tasty.  I love that I can pick the meals and I have a large chunk of my meal planning done along with the groceries for the meals.  Great way to get more balance to the diet and not to mention great way to try new foods that I may have shied away from before.\\nno problems..all went smoothly\\nCompletely and utterly terrible and unacceptable my dress came in a box which was completely wrecked my dress was torn the strap had fallen off and threads were coming out all over I will never use this site again and will do everything in my power to prevent others from using this site I feel as though I was scammed\\nI placed a special order for a mirror online without any issues. The confirmation was accurate. The mirror arrived a week earlier than expected. It was extremely well packaged and in perfect condition. The hanging system\\nworks well, even in drywall. I highly recommend this company.\\nWas looking for a bulb that didn\\'t know if they would have. Well they did. Happy customer.\\nRegenexx is a company of excellence.

But for adult women, it’s a win win!\\nMade an online reservation.  A week later I get a cancellation out of the blue.  The explanation is that the facility \"has requested to put a hold on reservations\", whatever that means.  Good thing it didnt happen the day before I was supposed to arrive.I was offered a $5 off coupon for my trouble.  An appropriate response would be to reimburse me the difference between what it will cost me now and the prepaid amount I originally contracted.  No.  None of that.  Company is probably run by a bunch of 20 somethings who have never been taught the concept of accountability.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nAs you can see, their response shows either no understanding of the issue or a terribly flawed business model.  \\n\\nThe issue is that your system indicated parking availability.  When a reservation, made a week earlier became inconveient, it was cancelled.  When that occurs, ParkWhiz should do right by their customer.\\n\\nThe other possibility is that ParkWhiz, has no clue as to the availability of parking with the vendors they represent.  Parking may or may not be available and always subject to a last minute cancellation.\\n\\nThe moral of the story: Deal with ParkWhiz and \"Hold Your Breath\", you may or may not have a place to park.\\nQuick and fairly easy- some difficulties getting the round trip dates entered. By far- best pricing !\\nI have been buying books for awhile now and last week received the wrong book.

My dissatisfaction is with the product itself. I ordered finger sleeves which only are available in assorted sizes so out of every box, I only can use the THREE LARGE ONES which fit; what do I do with all the rest?\\nI would like to be able to purchase these by one size only per box.\\nI had a great experience. Ordering was easy, Medisave kept me apprised of the status of my order frequently, it arrived promptly, the order was correct. I would absolutely order from Medisave again.\\nDelivery service is awful, will never order anything from HD again.

Package tracking not included with lowest cost shipping. Had no difficulties. Gave four stars, not five, because other sources offer extras. Used this one to try it as a source. Would use again\\nArrived very quickly.  It was exactly what my proof showed.  I will be purchasing more in the future.\\nSo, I\\'ve been going to college for...well...let\\'s just say WAY TOO LONG!

I am now pleased and do like the fact that I can back up multiple platforms with one account (Mac, Parallels and Synology).  I did like the way they offered to help and then did, hence the rating upgrade. \\n\\n\\nI have an account that I use for Mac and Synology.  I tried to download it to Windows 10 (running in Parallels on my Mac) and it absolutely under no circumstances will allow the installation to proceed citing an \"internal server error\"  when I try to logon.  After some online reading, I see that many have this problem.  I\\'ll be switching to something that works for Mac and Windows once this subscription expires.

When first opened they were great, now the experience is mediocre at best. Long times to check out, even longer for your car to be pulled up. All though you fill out all the info booking on line, you have to wait in line to give all the information all over again to be hand written. Have gotten the same employee on drop off the last three times. Acts like he is doing you a royal favor by accepting your information and keys. He was almost done and my husband asked the shuttle bus to wait a minute and the driver said he couldn\\'t. We got on the next one and the driver said we would leave in 5 minutes. Then he disappeared. When he got near again, I asked him when we were leaving as it had been over 5 minutes and he actually denied he said that! He wanted to wait for another couple who were at the check in desk.  Only go back because its cheaper.\\nI wanted a nice wig and just typed the kind I was looking for and voila.

Excellent work! Look forward to working with you more in 2018. Happy New Year!\\nI always use Newark Airport Long Term Parking for all my vacations. They run their operation like clockwork! On this most recent trip, as soon as I retrieved my luggage, I texted them and the shuttle back to the parking lot was already there as I exited the terminal. When we arrived at the lot, my car was already waiting with the keys in the ignition. The drivers are very friendly and help with loading and unloading heavy luggage. Their excellent service is worth the slightly higher price they charge compared to other parking lots.\\nI purchased 2 balloon bouquets and a flower bouquet for my mother across country when I found out she was admitted for and emergency surgery. It was the least I could do considering my husband and I are stationed with the military in .CA and my mother was in NC. Balloons were perfect, the flowers appeared nothing like the bouquet I ordered. So of course I contacted the customer service line, after sending pictures of the bouquet my mother received and going back and forth all day, I was finally told it was going to be made right and that my mother would receive a bouquet the following day that appeared more like what I ordered, so the next morning my mother received it and guess what still appeared nothing like what I ordered as far as the colors the bouquet was supposed to be. So I contacted customer service again, sent another picture, mind you up until this point everyone I had spoken to had been so understanding and polite. I went on about my day, while at a class with my son received a voicemail telling me they were more than likely not going to refund my money after the second flower delivery attempt but that I could call back to discuss the situation, so i called to speak with the young lady who had just left me a voicemail. Well the phone was answered but I never got a hi how are you today or anything of that nature but rather over heard the young lady who had just left me a voicemail and a gentleman discussing the emails I had sent and laughing about my request to refund my flower purchase because it was not delivered properly 2 days in a row. They were mocking the situation, I said hello many times this occurred for about 3 to 4 minutes, finally I hung up and called back and asked for a manager or supervisor, turns out the young lady who had left me a voicemail was in fact the person mocking and attempting to make a fool out of me, and the gentleman who was with her I was told was the owner. I was furious at this point, I told the girl how I felt and that what they had done was very unprofessional and disrespectful. We spoke for a good 25 minutes going back and forth and finally made peace with the situation, apologized to each other and she told me to give it 2 to 3 days and that our flower purchase would be refunded. So again I continue on about my day when all of the sudden I get a phone call from a .CA number, thinking it\\'s my son\\'s Dr. I answer, and a lady named Cynthia with the company was on the other end, yelling at me and being incredibly disprespcrful to me about a situation I thought had already been resolved, upon her yelling and rudeness I asked he why she felt the need to call and yell at me when she wasn\\'t even completely sure of the situation at hand which she then responded that I needed help and she hung up on me. I was in awe and shock. How amazing it was that this company is in the business of lifting individuals spirits when their families have loved ones in hospitals, to be treated with such rude disrespectful behavior makes me feel as if they are unworthy of the money their customers pay them to have a job. I did reconnect with the customer service line and speak to the so called owner, he said he was going to use this situation as a teachable moment for his team and I hope that is true because no one should have to go through the same situation as me. Needless to say, I will no longer use this business in the future.\\nThey give the best and fastest hosting, it’s of a great value for the money. It is just amazing how fast this hosting is with Drupal, even the performance is same as other top hosting companies but for the fraction of a price. The setup process is also very fast and easy, I very much liked their control panel dashboard, and you can watch your resources to check performance or even make a clone of your site. For Drupal hosting I would only suggest Cloudways.\\nI have been very happy in my experiences with Go Bus.  They are unfailingly courteous, generally run on time, and provide a pleasant riding experience. \\n\\nGo Go Bus!\\nWay to much messaging from the time I ordered the product.  Long wait to receive the product.

Very fast shipping and will definitely order from them again in the future.\\nI received my shipment on time, however I ordered a size 12 -18 month baby onesie and received a 18 - 24 month instead, which is *much* too big. As I was hoping to use it for a specific occasion, I did not have time to reorder the proper size in time, which left me scrambling to find something else.\\nI have decided not to return the item, as it will fit down the road, and I am satisfied with the quality etc otherwise.\\nTheir product was as good or better than I expected.\\nWorks wonderfully and really helps calm my anxiety!!!\\nReliable supplier. Good quality of goods and excellent customer service.\\nI had ordered some knit caps for my team, and when they arrived, they were way too small for anyones head.. Queensboro was nice enough to reach out to me, and resend the full order to me again, with a larger knit cap, an no cost to me.  I can say Queensboro stands behind their products!  Thank you Queensboro!\\nCasheNetUSA has been a life saver on so many occasions.  There are no hidden fees.\\nGood communication\\r\\nGood people\\r\\nGood experience\\nExcellent customer services and happy to be with Kin Insurance\\nPleasant experience\\nThis is a preliminary review as I am still in the Medical Billing Specialist program, but the videos are not well organized, the slides have typos and the pictures in slides aren\\'t clear to see and often not relative. The woman in the videos is so redundant, often saying the same thing three different ways in a matter of minutes. The videos make mention of terminology that is never spelled or is not even a vocabulary word, which I find ridiculous.  This is an anatomy class and if you are going to talk about it don\\'t assume the learner knows anything about what it is that you are saying. The book is not helpful at all. At the end of the chapter there are vocabulary words and next to them pages where the word was discussed. Well when you go to that page you simply find the word with a line next to it where a definition is to be inserted. Basically, they never define the word.\\n\\nI am highly disappointed and find it hard to even get motivated to work through this program. It is torturous to me.\\nEasy to follow, very informative and very helpful!\\nQuick turn around and had what I wanted\\nTypically we park in the Valet parking garage for shorter jaunts we take......3-7 days.

The service is prompt and I like the fact that I can change it to meet my needs or actually the needs of my cats.\\nTrust pilot has some charlatans.\\n\\nThere is a strong element of buyer beware, that is as one example, you will get contractors who simply give you a very high estimate then hire out the work. \\n\\nBe careful to read the reviews, hopefully, that lessons much of the risk.\\nA++ really fast and cheap\\nWe were upgraded to a BMW 320d. Very nice car indeed. Service at Sixt went well. Had to wait a little to pick up the car (as desk). Other than that, excellent service.\\nFriendly customer service.

The site is super easy to navigate and I really appreciate that.\\nRecently I\\'d seen Greek, and Roman mysteries and Christmas cookbooks advertised on tv, current book sellers, and in magazines .  I searched Thriftbooks.com and found all of them in good condition and much, much cheaper.  The shipping from various sources is fast.  I\\'ve ordered books from here in the past and have not been disappointed at all.  Also, the Wish List is handy for listing any out of stock book that I may want.  Soon I get a notice when it is in stock and  if I still want it. .  Such service is hard to beat!\\nWhen I first opened the package of the supreme briefs, I was a little worried. They are alot thinner than alot of over night briefs I\\'ve tried. But wow do they hold alot, and for me the cut fits me perfectly. I am 6\\'2\", 230, in case someone ready cares. But anyways I am very happy with this company\\'s product\\nI have nothing but good to say. My entire experiences have been fantastic. What I find even better than the overall ordering and receiving is that when I had one problem the customer service was efficient and exceptional. I’m going to rate thrift books.com as ten out of ten. Thank you.\\nNice framing and great prices!\\nI was with Ebid for 8 years then they billed me for a transaction that was never completed due to the buyer being a waster I emailed them and asked them to scrub the charge and they banned me! I have tried several time to get an answer out of them about this but they just lie to me and keep blocking any attempts to re-register!

I was angry about the way I was treated after so many years on their though.\\nFast and friendly service.\\nExcellent service and process.  Highly recommend.\\nI paid in advance for a room and was told that a shuttle would be waiting at the airport.

Not only he was professional but he made trust them for once.\\n\\nGuy Takoué\\nThe amount of required info is kind of insane compared to any other site where you can purchase games from. I thought it was fake, and had to do a lot of digging to see if others had used the site before and if they could confirm it being genuine. Luckily, this is a real site, but customers shouldn\\'t have to second guess like that.\\nI didn\\'t know what to expect when I called cruises.com, but my experience was great.  My agent, Emmy, explained everything to me, and answered all my questions honestly and thoroughly.

Thanks again, now i have unlocked phone.\\n\\nWould recommend anytime! :)\\nI thought that the company was pretty fair on how they deal with there customers. I also think that they do a good job taking care them from the reviews that I read.\\nThat is a best site I will tell my family and friends about it\\nGood service. Great car. Easy collection and drop off.  \\r\\nThe only critisism is that you have extra payments on collection...full tank of petrol up front 72euros and extra insurance (for windscreen and wheel cover) appaently not covered on the policy? 42 euros a one off payment, other wise you have to leave a huge 400 euro deposit, this came to 114 euros, £93. They have a pay for a full tank of petrol bring the car back empty policy which if you dont plan to do a lot of driving then you have paid out for petrol you do not use. I have used other companies where you collect the car full and return the car full, that way you only pay for the petrol you use, which i feel is a fairer way of doing it?\\nThere was a great selection of cakes available on the site. I was able to pick out the ideal item in a matter of moments. Ordering was easy. Delivery was on time and the cake was perfectly packaged. Only had to wait a little while for the cake to thaw before we could enjoy.\\nConvenient, fast and professional.\\nTop notch service and out of this world products !\\nThanks much...great service\\nI recommended booking with priceline every time\\ngood customer service. fast delivery. never have had any real issues. keep up the good work. thanks\\nI have used this company for personal trips in the past and never had a problem; however I have now used them twice for corporate travel and both times the driver was late, this last time almost 25 minutes late. In both instances, the driver said they found out the pickup time 15 minutes in advance and couldn\\'t possibly be to me in 15 minutes from the location they were in when they got the call. So it seems to me to be a dispatch problem (?). I don\\'t know. This time I almost missed my train, it was very close.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS TIME, my driver drove an entire block the wrong way down a 1-way street. My head was initially in my phone and I looked up when I heard a slot of honking and people were waving at him.  Really?  Even if you\\'re not familiar with your area or a specific street, you need to follow street signs. He didn\\'t seem to think this was a problem as he turned the car around and proceeded to take me out of my way for another 10 minutes. The driver didn\\'t seem to be able to get out of his own way. He wasn\\'t familiar with the streets and although I tried to provide him with directions, he wasn\\'t able to follow them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike I said, I\\'ve used this company in the past for personal trips and although it\\'s been a long time, I didn\\'t have a problem. This last experience was horrible and this company seems to be going downhill.\\nAwesome site to get giftcards! Problems fixed if gift cards don\\'t work. Never had a problem with this site.\\nEasy to navigate and to check out!\\nThank you Logan you were great.\\nPlaced a $120 order, which was shipped from Hong Kong.  22 days later it has still not arrived. HK shipping confirmation said it was shipped \"Trackable Air Mail\".  Somehow it ended up in the hands of postNL, a Netherlands based carrier.  Their last tracking update was 8 days ago.  I contacted HK and asked to cancel the order and give me a refund.  They said they could not do that until 40 days had elapsed and the shipment still not arrived.  Absolutely unacceptable considering it was shipped \"Air Mail\"!\\nMy dress had damaged hook. They had no other dress in this style. Your company made me pay for shipping back. I requested a return label and also requested not to be charged the restocking fee which your customer service rep said you would do neitger\\nFast delivery\\nService is excellent, as always.

The boxes are in a storage facility with no easy access until my house sells.  I needed/wanted to cook a special dinner for friends but one of my favorite cookbooks was in storage.  I went online to Thriftbooks, found the cookbook ordered it and received in just a few days.  My guests were happy with the meal I prepared and I was happy to entertain my guests.  The easy access, large selection, reasonable price and quick responsiveness of Thrift-books facilitated this successful dinner party to help me ay goodbye and thank you to some valuable friends.\\nThis was a very meaningful way to memorialize someone who recently died.  The family was deeply touched by the gesture and loved the materials that came with the certificate.  I highly recommend the Star Name registry.\\nVery fast shipping. Great experience. Great value and products\\nLike any other used book site, supply and price vary from day to day. However, the purchasing process is more streamlined. You are billed once for the entire order, not in bits and pieces as things ship. There\\'s no wrestling with your credit card statement to figure out if the cluster of charges match the amount you authorized. The threshold for free shipping is easy to reach.

The part was in great condition and was delivered EXTREMELY fast. This is definitely a site I would use again to order parts. Thanks for the great service!!!\\nAs the main employee user at Baked N Sconed I would highly recommend FiveStars to any business. I enjoy having the ability of the dashboard and seeing how many people we reach and how successful (or not) our promotions are. Our customers truly love it because they can earn rewards while we love it because it brings those customers in. We have the freedom to choose what we want to market and when. The truly only downfall is that we have chosen to not link it with our POS system because of compatibility reasons, but that really doesn’t effect our usage of the system. I love being a FiveStars business member and also using it as a customer!\\nI learned about strings by mail on a forum and decided to give it a shot.

If there are any problems they are quick to respond and remedy the situation.\\nYeah at last!\\nI have used First in the Sky many times for business or first class airline seats.  They are very responsive to my travel needs and have always found a good flight for my travel requirement. They work very efficiently and are very responsive and timely in finding flights that match my travel needs.  I would recommend their service to anyone seeking a lower fare for business or first class airline travel.\\nGot my comics in better condition than expected and got them quicker than expected, too. Woo hoo!\\nNot enough check in staff so flight left half an hour late - was kept queuing for an hour. Old fashioned confusing website, mobile check in unavailable without the app and not ready for the UK market\\nThis was the easiest way to reserve a storage unit I went on line reserved a size then received a call back and everything was confirmed easy as 1 2 3.\\nI ordered the Dovo bergischer Lowe razor. All of the images showed a razor with variances in the scales, a mix of black cream and white. There were other razors that cost a lot less by Dovo with all white scales but I didn\\'t want those and was willing to spend the extra (almost double) cost to get the really nice one. Much to my surprise what arrived in the mail was an all white scaled razor. What a let down! When I called the rep told me they don\\'t know what is being sent out (?) they just get them from Dovo and ship them to the customer. Well if  your going to sell something to someone maybe you should know what it is your selling? Hope to get this straightened out.\\nEasy to order, gets to me quick\\ngood and prompt and will be back again soon\\nI have purchased of free people several times and never have i been so disappointed as i was today opening my latest parcel.  Firstly since when does it take two and a half weeks for a parcel to be sent from Victoria Australia to NSW. Joke! I found a huge difference in the styling of a couple of my items compared to the Photographs on line so much so i actually do not like the items i purchased and will be returning them for a complete refund.  One piece in particular i was discusted with, the mock dress mini a classic black number, however i soon discovered once i tried it one had an extremely obvious inch cut out hole on the front of it that appeared to have once had a mending patch placed over it and another large hole in the seam.  How was this still sent out to a customer? I love the style of the black dress but will not be exchanging it for another instead ill be getting a full refund because i don\\'t want to be messed around any more.  I will be extremely careful if i purchase from free people again.\\nAlways on time transfers. Never disappointed me.\\nMy trip was not bad at all. It was my first time flying through this airline.

Staci Hissong is outstanding!\\nYou\\'re rising prices coupled with what I felt were cheapened variations of the products have caused me to put off on re-ordering for the for now.\\nis sorprendent\\nThis is my first purchase, so All I can say is that this one went through with no porblems.  Shipping was fast and free.  Would probably purchase from again.\\nGot product timely.....no problem\\nWe were very happy with the work that Andrew did for us!\\nGuys got it shipped to me faster than expected, and installation instructions made install extremely easy.  Great service\\nGood quality for the price.  Allow 4 weeks from the time you order until you receive your order.  Only issue was customer service agents were hard to understand.  Ok experience overall.\\nGreat.. finding movies that I have been looking for years for. I\\'m a hooked customer.. and the prices are great too..thanks again\\nWorking with Troy Davis has been such a blessing for my wife and I. He made the entire process easy to understand and gave us peace of mind. He definitely can be called a friend as he would be willing to help at any time with any concerns or just to talk. Thank you again Americor and thank you Troy for being great!\\nFair price, east to use, would use again\\nSeamless, flawless and timely.. My clubs arrived in Florida two days early... Price to ship 1500 miles was excellent. .\\nThe whole process was quick and easy.  Everything was explained to me and they were able to answer any questions I had.  Price was good compared to other storage locations in the area which was a huge factor for us.\\nThe cups I ordered came and are of good quality. The imprints are exactlky as I ordered and look very good.\\nNo problems. Will use again!\\nVery nice house in quiet neighborhood. Everything was done to a high standard in the house. Our kids loved the air hockey , ping pong and foosball tables in the garage. The house is close to grocery stores, a movie theater and was a good central location for Zion, Red Bluff and Snow Canyon parks. \\nOwners responded quickly to my messages.\\nWe feel like we found a gem and plan on staying again next time we visit Zion.\\nExcept for the camera\\'s not working properly I may not have ADT security system if I can\\'t get the system to work properly\\nOrdering the product, the shipment of the product, and the product itself (and my experience) were excellent.\\nThe area they need to work on (and fix!) is the team that calls customers on the phone. They are terrible. \\nIf you\\'re like me, if you don\\'t recognize the phone number of an incoming call, you let it go to voicemail. That is what I did following placing my order online.\\nTheir team doesn\\'t leave a voicemail. Instead, they call and call and call, about every 5 to 15 minutes, at all hours of the night! That is a really poor customer service move on their part.\\nI told them -- the first time they call a customer they should leave a voicemail message. Then call the customer back 1 hour later. By then their customer would have listened to their message, made a note of the incoming phone number, and the next time they called, the customer will answer.\\nInstead they call multiple times over and over until you answer. It is C-R-A-Z-Y!\\nIf you google their incoming phone number, you will see many complaints about this. \\nI think my solution will make customers happy.\\nThanks for being there when I really need $ome help.\\nA Little Skeptical at First\\nFlightsbird appears to use 3rd party vendors to handle their transactions.  So I experienced a language barrier problem. I was a little hesitant with giving my credit card information over the phone because I thought it was a scam.  Then my rep emailed me my personal information back to me with my full card information for verification.  Then I was really getting nervous.  But the rep never lost contact with me.  He called me directly all the time.  The 1st flight itinerary didn\\'t go through but the 2nd one did and my flight is confirmed and it was a much cheaper rate.\\nI am always very satisfied with NFM\\'s products and fast delivery.\\nI kept trying to stress that I would have a handicap man with me and I needed a rm as close to the elevator as possible I needed a refridgerator and he said he would have one sent to the rm.It seemed a little rushed so I will be very surprised if my and my husbands stay will meet his needs.He said there were only 4 rms left and if I booked now he woyld give me a discount,,seemed liked he was more interested in me booking than our needs.\\nI recommend that everyone sign up for Goldstar!  It\\'s wonderful being able to attend so many shows at a great discount.  Being a Red Velvet member has enabled me to get the best seats at a great price...so glad a friend recommended Goldstar to me. Join now!!\\nnot cheap enough\\nVery easy to search and quick to respond!\\nSo easy to ofrder and can\\'t wait to try them.\\nI don\\'t think I could have made a better choice in a turn-key professional office choice.  The staff at AEC Radnor go out of their way to deliver exemplary service.  My clients get the message that my firm makes good choices and cares for their welfare.  That\\'s what AEC strives for and they certainly accomplish it.  My clients and my staff both feel at home here.\\nI purchased a Monteverde Tool Ballpoint - Midnight Black and thought the price was $ 30.00 but the unit I received was a Model 60 at $ 39.00.  I was not aware of any difference and thought I had been overcharged.  The pricing and differences in units should be made clearer.  Other wise I have ordered perhaps 10 or 12 units plus refills and have been a happy camper up to the last purchase.\\nService helps me eat healthier. Some recipes require a lot of chopping which takes longer than estimated time to\\r\\nprepare.  Overall good service\\nquick service\\nConsumers have the option to travel First Class or Coach. TDS is the latter, First Calss service from start to finish.\\nEverything that they said they would do they have started the process and things are getting settled\\nOn time. Professional.

Set up was fast and efficient.\\nWe rented a car through Priceline and we got a full size car, Impala, with Hertz while we were in Seattle, WA, for my nephew\\'s law school graduation. Great car all around. We would go with Hertz again.\\nGreat Service @ Great Price\\nApart from the logo on the long sleeve T shirts, I felt that the shirts were average store bought quality but double if not more in price than comparable shirts on the market.  I realize the logo makes these shirts different but how much markup is needed to sell the product?  I would certainly have second thoughts before making further purchases.\\nAll of the house sits we have done have been most enjoyable.  Great homes, lovely families and their animals are always so lovely too.  I have recommended the company to friends who are now using you also and very pleased too.\\nThis company is awesome.  The plants are thriving when received and they are shipped when ready to plant in my zone.  The fact that they are \"local\" to me is also a bonus as they are in Connecticut and I am in NY.\\nThey stock the usual and unusual and every plant is an asset to the garden.\\nI use book it anytime I want to travel .they seem to have the best deals!!\\nOn June 8 I bought three books to be given as a present to the keynote speakers in a Conference, one week before the conference. Just after accepting the order, I realized that I didn\\'t choose the express shipment option (which is in my opinion not clearly visible), and I sent an e-mail to orders-HD-individuals@springer.com, asking if it were possible to change the shipment option or, at least, to know if the books would arrive in one week, to be able to react and place a new express order.  One and a half day after, I received an apparently automatic response telling  \"Please be informed that upon checking on our system, we could no longer change the address as well as the mode of shipment since the book was already delivered on June 6, 2014\" , a wrong date, before the order date, which was really sent on June 10 according to the invoice and, what is worst, no answer to my question about the delivery time. The Books arrived on June 18, after the conference end.\\r\\nThe customers deserve something more that the answer of a robot.\\nI ordered this dress for senior prom. The dress fit just as is said, but is very long. The dress also came right on time, in just 5 days. I would definitely recommend this website to anyone!\\nEasy ordering, timely deliverly and items arrived as ordered. Thank you.\\nSimple and efficient\\nAlthough the product is fine. I paid extra  for 2 day shipping and didn\\'t receive the item for almost a full week. I sent an email to customer service and have received no response.

A great company and very fair prices excellent work!!\\nEasy and smooth purchase on this well designed website\\nSneaky business practices.The clothes are a good quality, and the prices are fair. I really didn’t have a negative thing to say until today when I got an email about a sale, went to the site and filled my cart only to get to get checkout process and be told that I could not use the money charged to my account from a previous unused month. This money has already been charged to me, I should be able to use it at my discretion, not only with normal vip prices. This is despicable.\\nBest place I found for the bulbs.

The Catholic Company is my source for all things Catholic.\\nThis was my second order with Flashbay. My sales rep, Sophia, went out of her way to keep me informed as to the status of my order. The shipping was fast and the order arrived exactly as expected. I will be ordering from Flashbay again!\\nThis is the third time we have rented through AVR.  They have the lowest prices and quality vans.  We had a problem one time but they were quick to correct it. I would recommend them to anyone.\\nI felt a bit confused when I went to check out. I bought the $25.00 gift cards from Fandango. Instead of breaking them down it looked as though I was getting one gift card for $75.00 vice 3 for $25.00.\\nI give The Catholic Co. a 5 star rating....I like to call in my orders instead of ordering on line..The people I speak to are friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. I highly recommend this company to all.\\nReally great t-shirts but they sent one too few\\nWe absolutely love Hello Fresh.

Trivago\\'s 212 Customer Service number messaging said it could not accept anymore calls.  Finally went on back on line and found Hoteling site to cancel.  Charged me a $14.00 fee to cancel DUE TO THEIR BOOKING ERROR AND NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Never did speak to a live person.  Will never use Trivago or Hoteling again.\\nThe driver drove very well. A lovely vehicle, and a good service.\\nI\\'d use Go Bus again to get from Manhattan to the airport,\\nWashington to Manhattan or basically anywhere. PF (New Zealand)\\nQuick easy and hassle free\\nAlways quality merchandise, fast shipping, great customer service!\\nI recently purchased a laptop. This was on Nov 15, 2015. Nov 17 the money came out of my account so on the 20th I checked online since I had not received any email about shipping, only an email confirming the order was received. It said the laptop was delivered to Jefferson, GA. Note I live in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada and the order was placed at TigerDirect.ca. I called and was told that this is standard. It is delivered to Tiger Direct warehouse and then shipped on to the customer and that it would now be routed directly to me and I would receive an email. That was 2 days ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever heard a thing so started sending emails to customer service. Eventually they cancelled the order stating the item was lost between the cross dock. However didn\\'t refund me some $15.62 for shipping and some other laptop charge. Now after another few emails I will receive $13. Then a few more and another $1.46. Finally after sending another email that the missing money they had charged for laptop disposal I will receive another $1.15. So only lost $0.01 and spent time sending 9 emails trying to get a solution to my order. Worst company I have ever dealt with online. I Will never deal with them again, neither will my company nor anyone I can suggest to buy elsewhere. Please do not waste your time shopping here. Customer service is a joke.\\nNo overbookings and always had my room ready.\\nThey kindly allowed me to return a paddle that just wasn\\'t working for me (the handle was too large) when I misunderstood the return policy.  Tells me that they listen to their customers and treat them right.\\nWould be good for me if you had an Irish based server too.\\nI have placed orders with them multiple times over the phone. They are always very courteous and quick to answer. Their staff know the products well and can make confident, knowledgeable recommendations. Delivery is quick and simple and the high quality products arrive exactly as they are advertised on the website.\\nHave been waiting for this order for 3 weeks. Continue to make excuses and delay shipment every time I check on the status of the order. Customer service is disorganized and not very helpful. Will be looking elsewhere for these products next time.\\nNo problems with ordering,no long waiting period on the phone,and product shipped out in one day! Fantastic is all I can say.\\nThe recipes are delicious and creative with ingredients that are conveniently and precisely measured and organized making cooking fun, fast, and simple!\\nGreat product and prompt delivery\\nOur new system came with additional features particularly the ability to operate and monitor it with our phones when away from home. The video monitor system is particularly important to us so we can monitor out dogs while away for the day. we also like the remote access to our heating and cooling thermostat. The longer exit delay will be appreciated as we are getting older and a little slower.\\nI usually call nigeria with rebtel\\nVery Goood ! But They Don\\'t Accept Tunisia\\nreliable, trustworthy, and fast\\nI was very nervous about the whole Medicare application process.  I had little or any knowledge at all in what to expect.  Dianne Young (the Medicare Supplement Agent thru Medigap), was exactly who I needed to help make this whole application process a breeze.  She was so helpful, educated me in all questions I had and walked me thru step by step the entire process!  Her kind professionalism and phone call follow ups truly make her outstanding!  :)\\nQuick delivery and was exactly what we ordered. Shipped very nicely so nothing could’ve been easy damaged\\nIt feels weird at first. You find them, they offer high level content, and it feels shady. I talked to a representative, he gave me a link, and I signed up. I\\'m glad I trusted them. This is a one shot group. No problem, easy peasy, just show up. No scam, no bull. They were friendly and, dear  god, they are pros. I wish EVERY heroic run was like this. Raid finder is put to shame. They crushed heroic Antorus, carrying at least 5 people, and made it look like a regular dungeon. 2 hours. That\\'s it. 2 hours... for full Antorus. I will definitely be using them again. If you\\'re like me, you have a shade of doubt, but they give you THEIR battle-tags, they send you confirmation via email, they ADD you to the raid 15-20 minutes before it starts, AND they keep you involved the entire time. I am impressed, I am surprised. I am doing this again, Thank you.\\nI\\'ve ordered several watches from Jomashop. I love their prices. Nobody beats them. And they have such a great selection! But, I\\'ve had to problems with my orders. One order was never sent to me and eventually cancelled without any warning. I\\'ve tried calling numerous times, but I\\'ve never had a call answered. I am impressed with their fast email responses though.\\nThe ordering process was simple and I was able to get exactly what I wanted. The communication was good and delivery was promised.\\nJust got the most amazing dress for a very good price!

I will most definitely use them in the future\\nReceived a great product in a timely manner. Will order again if I need more parts. Great prices also.\\nAlways great customer service!\\nThe most disgraceful, arrogant, uncaring, thoughtless company.  They are a budget airline and flights should be reasonable. If their policy is  bump people off their booked flights as standard practice, then they should advertise this.  I regularly travel with flybe, easyjet, ryanair and jet2 and NEVER have I been bumped off a plane because it has been over booked. Vueling, you are disgustingly greedy with zero concern for your passengers. I will make sure to let as many people know how shocking your company is. You have spoiled what had been a great trip. To anyone that reads this review, I strongly recommend you check all your options before booking Vueling as there is a good chance you will be left twiddling your thumbs after losing your seat.\\nAs a first time relocating international, I was quite skeptical with the process and choosing the right movers. I am glad that I came across Universal. The team is so professional and meticulous with the entire process. They patiently answered all my queries and were so transparent with the bills pre-moving. I paid exactly what was quoted to me.\\n\\nThe team at the source location wrapped and packed everything with quality materials. I was able to track my shipment and it was delivered on time without any damage. The destination team unpacked and mounted my furniture all in a day.\\n\\nI am very happy with the services provided my Universal and would surely opt for this again in the future if needed.\\nthey sent me very good parts! but they took way too long to get here.\\nI loved everything!!!! Amazing!\\nI have recently purchased 3 mirrors from Mirrorlot and would highly recommend them. Order samples of the frames you are interested in because colors might be a little different from description. Packaging is superb and I had no issues with delivery.   Would definitely use them again and recommend them to my friends!\\nFirst of all the show room was huge with more of a on site selection. Secondly the salesman was very patient with me and helped me pick out a bedroom set that fit my credit limit so I could get my server I really really like too Lastly, the delivery went smooth. The guys laid out moving blankets on my floor and carefully moved and put my furniture together. They were very polite.\\nI’ve order d many times from World Soccer Shop in the last 10 years and have always had a good experience.\\nGreat earings, of the quality and size expected.

Thank you!\\nThe return policy sucks - \"once sold, the deal is done despite how bad the furniture is.\"\\nWhy should I recommend this store to anyone if once you buy something that turns out not as good, you are stuck with it? \\nFurniture is not an everyday purchase. I have bought couches before and I have been allowed to exchange.\\nBOOK IS IN GREAT CONDITION. ARRIVED WELL IN TIME. VERY HAPPY WITH THE TRANSACTION.\\nGreat job.  The guys that delivered the mirror were just so professional and friendly.  I had a class of 5 and 6 year olds that had to start at 5pm the mirror arrived at 4:30pm they had it up and all taken care of by 5pm and there was no delay in my class schedule !  my next one will be from you !\\nWonderful experience. Driver was 15 minutes early, called me when he arrived. Very courteous. Helpful with luggage. Overall best car service used.\\nLove my hair. Would give 5 stars but shipping costs are a little high\\neasy and quick to get my order on its way to me\\nI ordered a replacement grill for a Toyota 4runner.  The price was great, the time to ship was better than expectations, and the fit of the part was exact.   Thank you!\\nI was suprised at how quick the whole process was! I was referred by a friend who knows one of the people who work for the company, and the idea of not having to take time off work to go to a doctor office was very appealing. The sign up process took less than 10 minutes and talking to a doctor was also speedy. I only had to wait 5 minutes to speak with a doctor, and the conversation was quick and painless.\\nI was looking for quality and hoped that you\\'d be a bit higher quality than Omaha. I sent product to my daughter and son-in-law and they seemed to be as happy as could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey\\'d never tell me if they were disappointed but as far as I know, I\\'d use you again and suggest to friends they should do the same if they want to stay upper end.\\nTrue blue Service. No complaints, excellent service.. Hands Down, an awesome store..\\nThe item was as advertised, properly packed and received in a timely manner.\\nI had applied for an annual Chinese visa and only had 5 days to get it done.  I actually got my Visa early!!!  Thank you very much. I will use your service year after year.\\nLove to buy books for my kids in thrift books. The service is excellent and best prices.\\nOrdered performance parts for my 6.0 powerstroke and was pleased with service and fast shipping of my order! Will be buying from them again in the future! Would recommend to anyone! Thank you KT Performance!\\nWhile the daily rates were cheaper than most in the area, I would NOT recommend going to this location if you have anything of value left in your vehicle.  I had personal belongings in my vehicle (hidden in my center console), and they were not in my vehicle upon my return.  It says a lot about a company when their employees need to steal from their customers.  I will gladly pay full price at the airport next time to know my vehicle and it\\'s belongings are safe from theft.  The shuttle driver was very nice - that was the only positive from this whole experience.\\nI am absolutely crazy about these socks.  The logo is super cute!  The colors are so much fun! And they give your foot amazing support and make them feel great all day long.  I would give them a 5-star rating except for the fact that one pair of my socks (my favorite ones, sadly) fell apart after just two washes.  These are expensive socks so I would not expect them to rip apart along the seams so quickly. I bought eight pairs so I will have to see how the rest of them hold up. For now, I am loving the remaining seven pairs of socks and will probably buy more.\\nI have purchased twice from Pure Romance and so far they have NOT let me down! I really enjoy their products!\\nService and staff were excellent\\nThe taste is pretty good. I could tell that it had an artificial sweetner in it, that disappointed me somewhat. I really would have like no artificial sweetners added. It held me between 3 and 4 hours at a time. I haven\\'t used enough to see if I had much weight loss yet.\\nNo complaints really.  It would be nice if they had more views of their products so you could better see exactly what you were getting, but then again it is just a light socket that costs a couple of bucks, so I may be expecting too much.\\nFast shipping grate products, please keep up the good work. Definitely will recommend to friends!\\nPerfect!  Framing an old newspaper and needed a weird size...Thank you!\\nI like this company very helpful. Jeffrey was easy to talk to and no hassle I will recommend and would be using them for my next trip\\nNot perfect, had one surprise fee, but car was per spec and performed well.\\nVery helpful customer service.  Always willing to answer questions about getting the correct frames and lenses.\\nThe tracking system for cards is poor. It forces me to keep track of how many days it took to arrive and then I have to contact you to let you know it didn\\'t show up.\\nI am happy to use your service.  However the price seems to be high.  I paid almost 40 $ which I could get for a lesser amount.\\r\\ncan you allow some promotional rate or coupon.\\r\\nthanks\\r\\nsoorian\\nThomas was very friendly and Helpful.\\nPureFormulas has the best quality around and the prices are reasonable.\\nLove Fabletics! (Good) workout clothes are expensive. For $49.95/month you can get great clothes delivered to your door. And if you don\\'t see anything you like, or just don\\'t need anything at the time, the $49.95 credit rolls over to the following month. Also love that you can shop by the outfit! I see cute shorts in the stores all the time, but then I can never find the right top to go with them. I know the purpose is to just workout, but I feel like having cute clothes to do so in, helps with motivation and self esteem.\\nthe quality of your pens are excellent and the service was fast and professional...thanks\\nI\\'ve only ever had one experience of Free People, and that experience was poor enough to render this entire review. I had wanted the Voile and Lace Trapeze Slip for over a year, and being from the UK means it\\'s difficult for me to do so. So when FP launched its UK site, you bet I was pleased - and I placed the order on the £78 dress I\\'d wanted for so long.\\r\\nWell. The \\'item\\' took 3 weeks to arrive, and when it did, the wrong item completely had been shipped out to me, much to my sheer disappointment and dismay. Immediately I telephoned them to let them know of the error (calls to the US are expensive also) and the woman I spoke to was very rude and unhelpful. I told her what had happened, and she simply said \"....Ooookay then...\" as though the problem lay with me, not them. I put the phone down and sent an email instead.\\r\\nI was told to exchange the item and they\\'d send the correct one out to me. I specifically told them very explicitly that I wanted the item sent to my home address, NOT my university address as I would be moving out and all mail after move-out day is returned to sender. Apparently this didn\\'t sink in and I got an email from FP saying they\\'d dispatched the exchange... to my university address.\\r\\nThis added more stress to the pile and I ended up telephoning couriers I\\'d never even heard of trying to track my package. I ended up sending another email to FP telling them what had happened and I was furious with the service I\\'d received and at such great cost and stress to me. They then told me they would ship the item out to my home address with no further cost on my part - and this time, things went according to plan.\\r\\nI love the piece I bought, but something I noticed about it was that it was not as pictured on the website. The piece is a grey/blue coloured slip which, according to the picture on the website, has white lace insets, but the slip I got had black lace instead. I did expect this however, but only because I\\'d read customer reviews about the item beforehand. This is only a minor nit-pick, and I still really like the slip, but you should be getting exactly what you\\'re paying for and should receive exactly as pictured on the website. I informed the company about this and they offered me a 15% discount on future purchases, but the picture on the website remains the same. \\r\\nDue to the appalling misconduct of a site which harbours such expensive clothing I cannot recommend FP as a website - especially if you\\'re ordering from the United Kingdom. Maybe I just had an unfortunate one-off experience, though. I can\\'t speak for all their items as I have only bought one, but mine definitely wasn\\'t worth the price, as the material is quite flimsy and see-through. You can find similar items at H&M or even Primark for about a tenth of the price! I would\\'ve sent the item back but seeing as I\\'d gone to considerable stress and trouble trying to get it, I decided to keep it.\\r\\nOverall, very dissatisfied - But at least I got my item in the end!\\nMaxcine was extremely helpful with my concern regarding references not showing up on my account and did due diligence in recognizing that I may have created other accounts over time. Thanks so much for your help Maxcine!  You are very much appreciated!!!\\nThe ink arrived in only 3 days,  When I put it in I was able to print a few pages.  The next day it would not print--tool ink out and put back in, shut off printer.   Finally had to call----no number with the ink that came--so had to find the web page again.  They did help me, but still had to do more than once.\\nThe ordering process was easy.  The mat came sooner than I expected and it was an exact fit.  I have all Exact Mats in my Lexus.  They always stay in place.  A great product.  Have had them for 12 years.  Only the driver’s side has had to be replaced  due to wear.\\nVery nice driver, comfortable car, and good ride.\\nPart was shipped in good condition, but took longer than I would have liked.\\nThe prices are great, most lately my order has been wrong. I did not like. My country also did not help! \\r\\nA while ago I made some requests and they never arrived! Never even lag 100 days! It is a problem, perhaps more trouble than my country than the HD. Another case my products arrived incomplete and I\\'ve never won more! That\\'s the problem with buying them!\\nI needed the item I ordered for a radio show on a certain date.\\nWhen I saw fast and cheap as a shipping option, I took the bait.\\nWhen it had not left the gate a day and a half later (tracking revealed it had not even received the item a day after that) I called to cancel. A cordial representative told me they would try to cancel. No dice. It did not happen.\\n I\\'m a five star online seller myself.\\nThere are too many good sellers in a competitive market for this kind of performance. Sad trombone noise here.\\nThis is a review of yahoo mail not yahoo in general. Very bad service whether using paid or unpaid yahoo mail. Search does not work and many times mail will be inaccessible. Currently switching to Gmail.\\nNamita and Harun really worked out a good flight deal for me with patience, I asked them for a change and they looked at different options to get me a reasonable fare. I really appreciate their time and patience. Thank you very much to both.\\nI got an email saying that my booking was canceled since the flight was not available for that price anymore. It also said that my money wasn\\'t deducted but just blocked. However, I got a notification that it was deducted. I\\'ve also read many bad reviews about Bravofly and now I\\'m worried that my money won\\'t be back within a few days. I really need it to book another flight. I\\'m writing this here because I saw that many complained about their emails not being read and not getting any reply and I hope this will be read soon. I\\'d like to get a proof of the money being released back to me and my bank being contacted to speed up things.\\n\\nUpdate: I talked to my bank to check for my money. They said I could get it back at the beginning of September. That\\'s too late! Why can\\'t you just deduct the money correctly and send it back, if you don\\'t need it instead of blocking it? That\\'s stupid! I have to travel before September! I\\'ll never ever use Bravofly again to book!!!\\nI would recommend this company. I had a very professional and personable representative, Chris. It is because of him that I am so happy with this company!!\\nArrived on time, as described and correctly lettered.

Very nice looking pens and they write good also.\\nThis was my first time using VRBO and it definitely will not be my last. When I started my search on VRBO I only knew we wanted to stay in Florida. I was impressed with the ease of searching for multiple locations and the filters to get the specific place you are looking for. I would absolutely recommend it to plan your next vacation!\\nI like the Epsom salt rub very much.\\nThe catalog selections and prices are very good; appreciated the fact that they kept me informed of the status of the items.\\nI first tried the trial packets and like them so I decided to buy a bundle and I got the cookies and cream tub and I honestly can\\'t drink this one it doesn\\'t taste good at all. It wasn\\'t one of the trial\\nPackets I got I wish I would\\'ve tried it first because I really liked some of the other ones.\\nthank you pretty fast process\\nexactly as shown, fast service  would order from walter drake again\\nOrdered a quite connect 20k standby, took the day off work to receive the unit when it arrived it was crushed on one side  A new unit is to arrive between Christmas and new year\\'s day we\\'ll see if my rating can be upgraded then.\\nHotel had no heat on first day.  I called the front desk and they told us it was turned off for the summer.  It must have been 30 degrees in the room due to air conditioner being set on low.  I caught a cold and was sick for three days and loss my voice.\\nReceived them today, look great, anxious to put them on\\nnice price and shipping is so fast\\nLooking for a job as a new grad is always hard, even with my home health experience. Every morning when I woke up I checked my email for updates from Indeed and it gave me hope and renewed energy to keep trying. I found what I was looking for! Awesome!!! Thank you\\nGavin was amazing.  He made sure to update me in regards to the problems I was having with my order and made sure I did not get off the phone before he could find out everything about it.  I appreciate his attentive demeanor and help during my call.\\nBest call I’ve ever made! Easy peasy! Fast, reliable, and extremely efficient!\\nThe checks have been printed and sent within a timely fashion.   It would be nice if the cost of the shipping and handling were more reasonable.  These two items cost me just about what the checks did.\\nDO NOT SELL ANYTHING ON THIS SITE THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS!! \\nI sold a dress and accurately listed and described the dress (a designer wedding gown lightly used). I even went above and beyond with the seller to send additional videos etc. before the purchase so she knew exactly what she was getting. She was aware there was a no return policy, and but apparently after receiving it decided she wanted to return it so she damaged the dress and sent it back to tradesy returns who took it without communicating ANYTHING to me, the seller. They took the return citing it as \"misrepresented\" on my listing. I received the dress back with new damage from when it was in their possession/the sellers possession and have not been compensated for my sale. \\nTRADESY IS A THIEF!!! I\\'m now out $75 from shipping and insuring the shipment from sending it to the buyer AND now have what was a beautiful wedding dress with minor wear that has ADDITIONAL DAMAGE AFTER TRADESY HAD IT and they are offering NO compensation for their mistake. In fact, they haven\\'t even responded to the four emails I have sent them today asking for a manager to call me. This issue is NOT resolved and they should be sued. I\\'m assuming they only gave the buyer credit on the site after her return which means they keep the $1100 from my sale and give me a newly damaged dress back. \\nI sent proof showing the difference in the dress I sent to the buyer with what they returned to me and this is the best part... LAURA FROM TRADESY then said it looked exactly like the pictures from the listing which proves it was like that before. IF THEY THINK THE PICTURES AFTER I GOT THE DRESS BACK LOOK LIKE THE LISTING THEN CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW \"I MISREPRESENTED IT\"!?\\nThis company is a nightmare, their \"Member Care\" doesn\\'t care at all and oftentimes won\\'t even write you back (and don\\'t even bother trying to get a phone call from them). DO NOT WORK WITH THEM AND DEFINITELY DON\\'T SELL ANY OF YOUR POSSESSIONS ON THEIR SITE! I see many other reviews on here stating the same so clearly I\\'m not the first person they have done this to. What a shitshow of a company.\\nIm a picky customer but these guys have exceeded my expectations. Very professional and helpful. Any issues are resolved fast and the web chat support guys are the best ive ever experienced !!! \\nIm hosting multiple sites and i have complete faith in Hostinger\\nI orders 1 hat, and 2 calendar for Christmas.  Upon ordering, I was confirmed a delivery around 22nd of December.  Hat came in first, quickly,\\nbut by December 24rth, the 2 calendar (the most expensive orders) didn\\'t show up.  Very disapointed.  When I  tried to track my package, no tracking was available.  Will not order from there again.  I may add to this when the UPS show up to my door...\\nFAST , FRIENDLY , & Courteous ::)! I ORDERED AN IPOD TOUCH !!\\nFound exactly what we needed at the best price available.

He immediately understood my quandary and very efficiently hooked me up with one of the few providers who could do a same-day weekend activation. Add to that his personable demeanor and perfect diction and you have the ingredients for the best customer service experience I have had in a very long time, if not ever.\\n\\n[For the record, I almost never take the time to offer positive feedback, let alone gush. Nope, my thing is letting the organization know that talking to a parrot in a distant call center who repeats everything I just said by way of attempting to sound sympathetic causes me to start pressing the ice pick harder and harder into my temple. \"I understand how frustrating it must be that your package was not delivered on the date that you were promised.\" So know that I have a pretty high threshold for being pleased.]\\n\\nAnyway, thanks Daniel. I am enjoying an evening of air conditioning while being not murdered.\\nI\\'m going to recommend parts geek to anyone who needs to auto parts. Thank you.\\nFixed iPad camera.\\nPut my order in and I received my order two days later. Aim just so happy.\\nI like the service. It was on time and very good price.

Good customer service and communication.\\nWish there was a way to put in multiple isbn at a time\\nWhen I was doing this I did check other sites and got anywhere from 50cents to like dollars more for the same book... so buyback pricing could be better.\\nI ordered 15 loquat trees, and they arrived a little banged up with a few torn leaves and a few blackened leaves.  However, all of the trees had white roots and green stems, so I am very satisfied with them and they will bounce back with a few months of care.\\nitr takes too long to load and use\\nThank you for giving me a loan\\nI\\'ve buyed a Zinvo watch in Black Friday and i also got my shipping information with Zinvo Founder!

I felt that my husband and I were cared for and that our best interests were at the heart of everything.\\nVery fast delivery and item was as described. Thank you!\\nThe product I\\'d give 5 stars but since I had ordered it online I\\'d never do that again I have order this product twice now and both times it was halfway out of the box the first one was indamaged but the second one the light bad was dented and messed up if never order online again I\\'d get it from a 4 wheel parts store\\nGreat CS team. Thank you!\\nHad problem with order - They worked hard to resolve situation and kept in contact through the process\\nGreat Service, great prices and awesome bundles.\\nI ordered a pair of Serengeti Velocity Rx sunglasses October 2016. The first pair arrived within an acceptable time limit, obstacles taken into consideration (not FDs fault). These felt \"wrong\" when wearing them...as if my vision was skewed. A local optician checked the prescription, and showed me that the Pupil Distance was pretty far off! I wrote to FDs support, and was quickly contacted by JenniferC, who almost immediately sent me an RMA number. Returning the sungalasses took way too long, more than a month in transit (Christmas and all), but even BEFORE Jennifer had received my RMA frames, a new pair of Velocitys had been ordered, prepared and sent to me (I live in Denmark).\\n   Unfortunately, even this pair \"felt wrong\", and the PD was again shown to be off...just not as much this time. Still uncomfortable for me to use, though. It has later been admitted by Serengeti that they have had difficulties in producing an exact PD when making Base 8 wrap lenses (curved lenses), but some people it just doesn\\'t bother at all and they have no problem using them. Unfortunately not me. I\\'m really sorry that they couldn\\'t make them for me, because I love their glass/lens quality (and have for many years).\\n   JenniferC and AprilB have jumped through hoops to make me a satisfied customer, and we have agreed that I get the full amount that I have payed for the glasses back again. It won\\'t have cost me more than the amount of two return package-fares to find out that Velocity Rx\\'s didn\\'t work for me.\\n   I can with certainty say that FramesDirect has not made a nickel off of me ... quite the contrary ... and yet I am still an utterly satisfied customer. Why, you may ask, when you didn\\'t get what you wanted? Well, because of JenniferC and AprilB...they did what they could with more patience than I myself would have had. Cudos, girls, and thank you for your assistance. I will probably order from you again, when I find the right model!\\nAt first I was disappointed. \\r\\nThe image was pretty pixilated and the curtain itself was very thin. \\r\\nI almost returned the curtain but after I put it up, it grew on me. \\r\\nFor the price ($50+) paid it should have been much better quality!\\nGood selection & prices, prompt delivery, A+ !\\nDealt with Paul from the first call to keys back in hand. I shopped around and found him engaged, informative, committed to the customer experience, and professional.\\nEasy and fast!\\nLove the sets!\\nThe sizing and quality of the t-shirts were above my expectations!\\nBy using Easy Comforts auto-refill option you don\\'t have to worry about not getting your necessities.\\nIt was hard for my wife to get the car out\\nAmazing team, great quality , reps are great .

The necklaces came just as I was hoping them to look like. quality looks very good. the little bags the necklaces came in was perfect! didnt even need to go out to buy a box for it. very impressed. will be coming back this website if I need to order again!\\nA little pricey but no wasted letters and easy to apply.\\nAt first I was a little skeptical about purchasing a book from this online site, but I\\'m happy that I did.

Very disappointed in the product!\\nVery good things, I like it\\nThis home is absolutely wonderful.  You can rest assured that all you really need to bring is your toothbrush!  It has an amazing location on the golf course and the pool and spa are stunning.  It is spotless and beautifully furnished and it\\'s...comfortable.  I would stay here, no questions asked, on my next stay in La Quinta.  And...the owners, Glenn and Astrid are the nicest, most accommodating people you could ever hope for.  You cannot go wrong with this property!\\nBest experience with. VP communication.\\nit\\'s fast and confidential I love it would most definitely use this again\\nEverything was fast and very clear.\\nI had one question about the boarding pass.\\nJowelle B. at your servicedesk helped me out in a few minutes and send the boarding pass directly by mail.\\n\\nI\\'m very satisfied with the service\\nIn both cases I did not know of a professional to do the work needed. The people recommended by Home Advisor did good work in a timely manner with reasonable cost for the service.\\nI chose a level 100-110 level boost and then contact me a week after I made the purchase. They said it is bank problem but I don\\'t actually know. I got to 110 myself by the time they contact me. So they helped me to switch my order to +15 key boost. I chose lower karazhan for mythic score. The run is fine, I went on there as healer rather than dd so they look for a dd in grp finder. Tank did make some mistakes. The Mage gave good dps but not all of them. (At least from my point of view. I\\'m a 935 H priest with 1900+ Mythic score). Team would be a better boost grp with cr. (at least for my point). The dungeon with this week affix is quite tricky. Not very happy coz we didn\\'t finish in time. There can be more improvement. To me it doesn\\'t worth the amount of money I spent but it differ from ppl. So choose wisely.\\ni like the online and  best prices and options available and I already booked 4 times and each time I got the best deal compared to any other airlines.\\nProcess went very smoothly.  Got a reasonable quote upfront, customer service got back to me super-quick, so I sent my documents in for translation.  True to word, they were back in my inbox in 48 hours.  Had them proof read by a native speaker and she verified they were good to go.  Have not sent them in officially yet, so cannot speak to whether or not they are acceptable for official purposes (will find out tho!).  Would definitely recommend Rev to a friend.  Quick, easy, and you know costs upfront.\\nVery easy to order and received shirt promptly.   Will definitely be a repeat customer.\\nBesides the taxes, everything else seemed ok!!! \\nTax were a lil much...\\nshipped quickly, wished for more designs on what I wanted.\\nGreat stuff at great prices\\nFound a book from my childhood! It was in wonderful shape and arrived very quickly!!\\nVery very happy with R&G Brenner tax service. Peter Pascarelli was the shining star. He has been doing my taxes for 5+ years. He helped me tremendously with getting credit for my repairs that were done during Hurricane Sandy. I highly recommend him to anybody that needs a tax specialist. \\n\\nThanks again,\\nErol Fettahlioglu\\nHave purchased so many things from here but would love to see MAC makeup\\nFast shipping, wide variety can\\'t beat it.\\nGrubhub brings me the best food around. They have a better selection of restaurants than other delivery services and the order is always right!\\nWent to Philadelphia through CityPASS in October 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really like the aspect that we planned a few days longer than our tickets lasted.  That way, we used up the tickets in the first several days in the city, then used the last couple days to visit things we saw while traveling between the CityPASS ticket venues.  In Philadelphia in particular, there is an upgrade on the Philadelphia Trolly Works and Big Bus Company ticket from a 2 day ride pass to an 8 day ride pass.  I strongly recommend this upgrade as it will make getting around the city much cheaper and easier (as you can park at the Constitution Center all day and ride from there instead of finding your own way everywhere).\\nSimple process and reasonable price.  Professional and courteous service.\\nSounded like they wanted to help, but ended up  just being a paid advertisement for a credit company.  I can get my scores for free.  I know my score and I know why it is where it is.  I am working on it, but in the mean time I need a vehicle.  I need a loan, not someone to explain my credit to me and charge me an auto pay of almost $40.00 month for it.\\nLove shopping at Thriftbooks. Great selections.\\nShipping service is unreliable.\\n\\nMany errors on the website pertaining to product information.\\n\\nOnly reason I shop here is because of the good selection of parts.\\nService is excellent. I have an electric car and they were great about charging it while away. Also their car wash, inside and out, was well done. \\n\\nWish they had direct shuttle to NJ rail station. We weren\\'t using the airport, wanted long term parking while staying in Manhattan.  This can be a good business especially for Tesla owners who want to drive to NYC.\\nMr. Erick Z. Have an amazing attitude and he could help me with so much clearance, even when I told him that i\\'m not so good speaking english.\\n\\nI\\'m truly surprised with the amazing suport service. Thank you very much Erick.\\nI love the beautiful items on the site. I\\'m a techie and it still took me several tries to get my custom order configured in the website.  I only need to pick an fabric color and a wood finish--but it took multiple tries on my laptop.\\nSupport by Chrono24 is very trustful and I\\'d like to buy again via Chrono24.\\nPerfection!

Thank you again for your help!\\nwhat u  save  on  ur creditors,  u pay  to them in settlement fees!=  beware!\\nThe book was an obscure title that is very useful to me, but hard to find.  The condition of the book was new and the delivery was pretty speedy.  Everything was good - thanks!\\nVRBO is great . I have used it for years. However, The price per night while searching is frustrating. I take time to open it up only to find that in some cases the price per night ends up being double what’s posted. For example.... I put dates in that I need. Possibly  Searching for 150 dollar a night property for two nights. Two nights should not end up being 600.It’s a waste of time in my search especially when I am narrowing my search down to price per night. I understand fees and taxes but when those fees are excessive it’s frustrating and price per night seems pointless.\\nUnless you want to stay in a hotel and get a free shuttle and parking, or stay in one of the far-away LAX parking lots, this is your best choice.\\nRecently purchased some vent replacement Flaps, was WOW\\'d When they arrived in 2 days!!  In time to be installed before our Trip. \\r\\n\\r\\nAwesome Service !!\\nWe were very happy with the quality of our purchase.  We needed to research a little more to find out what to expect... Anyway, needed to upgrade and are in the process of sending back for this.  The site has been extremely helpful and feel safe dealing with these people.  Something which is important when you are purchasing online.  Looking forward to getting our updated ring!\\nLang wall calendars are superior in quality and artwork. Instead of hanging a calendar, you are complementing the artwork already in your home.  \\nWe live on a large lake in northern Minnesota and prefer calendars that blend into our environment, whether the four different seasons, lakes, terrains, plants, etc. or the neighbors we live with (bear, moose, deer, fish,etc).\\nthis was the best deal I could find after 2 weeks of shopping. The shipping was very fast, the parts were complete with all accessories included. I couldn\\'t be happier with north shore!\\nExcellent car rental in service and worth of money. Got the car I ordered, a clean and relatively new car. 2 weeks with no problems.\\nUsing Wally Park has taken the stress out of parking.  Valet parking is so convenient.  I also like the covered parking in winter - I don\\'t have to dig the car out of the snow.  They seem to be a good company to work for.  I see the same employee faces over time - an excellent sign.  Everyone is so nice and really makes my air travel more pleasant.\\nBooks came promptly and without mistakes. Anticipate using you again.\\nMy beloved Doxie \"Roxy\" had passed away and I was in search of something very unique and special. After a few hours of searching I found Mainly Urns. I placed my order with ease. There was nothing confusing about the website. Within a day I had a order confirmation and proof picture of what my urn would look like. Within the week my run had arrived and it is amazing! I love the black granite. The writing and picture turned out great. I don\\'t look forward to ever having to do this again but when the time comes I will be placing my order with Mainly Urns!  \\r\\nThanks for an amazing final resting place for my baby\\nFacility was clean, offered great specials, and provided friendly and knowledgeable staff. My over all renting process was quick and pleasant.\\nAfter one time wearing and washing them, the socks were coming apart at the seams.  I ordered four pair and all are now coming apart so it wasnt just one bad pair. I will never order socks from here again.\\nThis is the best store to buy your A/C needs.

Ingram\\'s customer service was amazing!!\\n5 Stars guys!!\\nHighly recommended Foodler! It\\'s a great way to find good food in a new place and it\\'s so convenient. Way better than calling to order and having to give your payment info and address every time!! Plus, Foodler has some of the best customer service around. I made the mistake of ordering Chinese from a place in Boston and when I told Foodler the food was inedible they credited my account $25. Really can\\'t think of anything bad to say about them!\\nmy title says it all. i will and have recommended this site to lots of people.\\nBig selection, nice prices, Dog food arrived in great condition and fast.

You can get some really good deals.\\nThe labels were not acceptable. I called customer service and the representative refused to re-do the labels. I am not happy with Walter Drake’s performance or lack of commitment to customer service. Next time I need labels, or something else, I will never again use Walter Drake.\\nits not easy to use\\nSuper custumer service. Quick and very kind on the top of the high quality production\\nThe book was in great condition and was delivered on time unlike others. I\\'m sure to begin my searches for other books here.\\nIt was easy to narrow down and find what we were looking for in a hotel.  There were a lot of reviews so we could get a general idea of the hotel. Good price. And I appreciated the follow-up emails with the itinerary and follow up emails. I feel like every aspect of the stay was covered\\nIt was wonderful\\nWe had a great time. The cabin was beautiful and had everything we needed. I would go again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend staying here.\\nEasy and fast\\nI spent over an hour walking around NYC trying to find where to board the bus...even after getting direction 3Xs from people who should know the area (policemen in patrol car, garbage man, an commercial vehicle parking garage). The street address in the email sent out is not quiet accruate either. I had to call you, Go Bus, and speak to a customer service rep, who help find the bus. The bus pass me as I had gotten close which also help me to find it but once do I got there, the bus driver was very abrupt and rude. I walk up to the bus as the driver was coming off the bus and before I could ask him anything, he just walk off the bus and past me saying (with poor english), \"too soon bus.\" I turned to asked him another question, saying excuse me, sir...sir...excuse! He kept walking and ignored me. I repeated myself saying the same words a little louder in case he did not me but he kept on walking. It was first time riding the bus. Not the best experience if you hold any importance to word of mouth...for obvious reasons. The ride itself and the fact I got to my finally destination early after a horrible experience because of the bad Nor\\'easter storm that hit the area in the form of heavy rain and wind left me stranded in NYC at the airport with no place to stay and an exceptionally large smount of money for a Urber to a noisy little sleepless night at an Airbnb. The the bus was my only alternative way home. My seat was not clean either. So yeah...there\\'s allllll of that. Side note: if you consider rethinking the first bus departure schedule for the bus that leave NYC to BOS so it coordinate with first Long Island Long Beach train arriving at Penn station, that would be nice too. I was in a panic trying to get back to Boston for work after all other form of transport was either canceled, sold out or not running to get from point A to B. Thanks\\nI use the clear hanging bags, they display very nicely. Thanks for a great product and good price.\\nGreat customer service. However the AC in our vehicle wasn\\'t working properly.\\nNever a problem with my orders - packed very well.\\nWhen I was not able to fly as I had planned, I began the process to file a claim.  This was easy only because I elected to use paper and pencil, not being computer literate enough to do it on-line.  The form was easy to fill out and my mother\\'s doctor was kind enough to document in his letter why I was needed home.\\r\\nI would use this insurance again.\\nThis is the worst holiday portal you will ever use - do yourself a favour and don\\'t bother.\\r\\nIf you need to change or amend anything - the telephone numbers do not work - they will not reply if you use their portal.\\r\\nThey are impossible to get in touch with - my worst internet booking ever.\\nThe application is Okay, except some times it does not deliver reports from the target phone.\\nLove buying books from Thrift Books. Never pay full price for books when you can buy them here, shipping is awesome as well!\\nExcellent was able to change pick up time no problem very courteous.\\nIS OK BUT IS WHAT THEY TELL IM STILL GETTING  BILLS LIKE 38 DLS A MONTH  AND THEY TELL ME IT WAS JUST 8.67 DLS FOR CPS CONNECTIONS  FEE\\nOutrageous! Customers are asked to take mug shots of themselves holding their ID and driver\\'s licence as a way of verifying their identity. Totally dispecable beyond imagination.\\nAll is ok, the service client is perfect.\\nI\\'ve ordered from them before and have always had great products from shirts to a license plate but this order was 2 shirts , Blanket ,pillow , travel mug , coffee mug all with print from my favorite tv show \"Smallville \". Absolutely thrilled with the quality of the prints and equally happy with the products they were printed on. Great company and shipped very fast.  Thanks\\nThis is an awesome company very efficient would recommend\\nI really like CafePress.  For the ~$30 or so we spent per shirt, I would have expected a higher quality product.\\nI ordered a candy I\\'ve been wanting for years. When I ordered it the site said they had 2 left in stock. A few weeks later I\\'m notified that my order was canceled cause the item was no longer in stock. They never took their money which is good, but I was disappointed that I didn\\'t get my item when it\\'s very hard to find.\\nOut of the many survey sites I have used, this one is by far the easiest and the quickest. I think it took me three days to get to $10? I only do it for an hour or so a day so it would be even faster if I was on it more. I had the money transferred to my paypal and it was immediate. Most sites make me wait a week or something, so I was very pleased\\nI would like to thank Shun for his great help!!\\nBeautiful looking product, easy to apply.  Fast turnaround.\\nPrices are laid out pretty accurately\\nI have ordered a few times now. The price is excellent, shipping is reasonable and extremely fast. I have absolutely no complaints.\\nI needed my order for a function and I needed it very fast. Placed my order online, standard shipping and the item was deliverd before anticipated (their delivery date). I would recommend ordering from this company to everyone!\\nEasy to use - usually gets best deals.\\nYou CAN save tons if you aren\\'t picky about exact location.\\nThe printer that I purchased was a great deal and arrived promptly. Everything works great.\\nLove book renter. They save me a ton of money since I do not qualify for financial aid. Everything I\\'ve ordered from book renter has come in the mail in no time.\\nI haven\\'t been able to land a job our interview just yet, staying hopeful\\nI had a great experience selling my car with Peddle. They were all so nice and helpful. They really made it so easy. Will always call them when selling my car and would recommend them to everyone I know.\\nExtra money back and a quicker/seamless process unlike the one offered on behalf of the retail store.\\nFrom the beginning, the broker selling the boat was slow to respond to requests for info, pics, etc. When we actually set up a time to view and inspect the boat, I inquired if we could do the closing the same day if the boat was acceptable, as it was a 6 hour trip to get to the boat, and I wanted to avoid making this trip twice just to sign my name and hook up to the boat. Broker said twice it wasn\\'t possible to close on the same day, then the morning of said maybe it was possible....back and forth. After we saw the boat and we\\'re waiting (again) to hear from the broker about closing, I went around him and spoke to the closing coordinator, who actually new what she was doing and said it would be no problem to close same day (apparently the broker had no idea of this.) We also wasted about 1.5 hours because the broker didn\\'t make an effort to have the boat delivered to the closing office as we requested- which instead causes us to travel out of our way twice when we didn\\'t need to. There was no customer service from the broker- nothing was done by him to make the process as seamless as possible. I feel he didn\\'t have any experience in sales or in customer service. We were able to close the same day, which is not the norm for this company. With a different broker I would give them another shot.\\nWow! Ordered these a/c hoses for my 2006 Acura TSX and were kinda worried since the cost was quite relatively low; but, first surprise: they arrived within a couple days from Jersey ... all the way across the country AND Pacific Ocean to Hawaii! Amazing! Second surprise: they were well made with good materials. Then, the hoses were put in the very next day and voila! Third surprise: they were a great fit. Now I be seriously chillin\\' ... AND seriously very impressed with this first-time online experience with PartsGeek. Highly recommended to all car owners needing parts no matter where you live in the US!\\nI have used AGODA since 4 years back. This website is very comfortable to find any hotels worldwide and also provide points which I can pay for reservation with next time.\\nExcellent service and very professional\\nGreat website. I have bought many vaporizers from Vapor Nation and everything that has been delivered to my house from them is always in perfect condition and works great. Have not had any problems with VaporNation at all yet.\\nCheapest flight but haven\\'t used it before. Have to give a review later.\\nThe Zaggora prints are funky and fun and although the pants did not work for me, my experience with the team at Zaggora was completely positive.  I called at about 10pm on a Tuesday night and left a voice mail message which I thought would be heard in the morning and they would call me as I gave them my cell phone number.  Instead I woke up to an email as to how to return the items....what a concept \"customer service on the highest level\"...Wonderful to work with such a company with complete work ethics for the consumer, and rare find these days\\nVery easy to use and found the best prices using Justfly\\nIt can often be difficult to place a gift order from overseas. No problems here, and great selection of quality gift baskets.\\nI like everything about this site, to be able to put multiple items in one shipment is awesome for me seeing I life in Hawaii and shipping can get a bit costly.\\nThe waiters the houseman everything was perfect I will be back next year Kelly Brown\\nCame as promised in a timely manner.\\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nQuickly remedied the situation. Many thanks to the delivery crews and store personnel.\\nI love it,  only my complain is when i place the order i have to fill the all my information again\\nWebsite was fine, but can\\'t give you an opinion on the product until we receive it :)\\nFast shipping and friendly customer service\\nI don\\'t want to take them off.\\nPerfect Transaction\\nIt was a little drawn out. I did have to put $800 more down than the RoadLoans terms showed. I also had to choose a very specific vehicle based on years, mileage, price etc... However I ended up with a great vehicle and used a wonderful dealer of my choice! Love my new Elantra!\\nMy name is Claire Gravell and I purchased this course on Groupon. Being a bit skeptical of doing an online course, it was very easy to use and if you had any trouble there is an online chat that is instant in answering any questions. I learned what I needed to and very impressed with how things were handled!\\nI have been in foot pain for 9 months now and oofos have made me feel human again. They are amazing! I have the sandals and now the sneakers. I truly feel like they have helped my feet feel better ! I am overjoyed that I found oofos shoes !\\nHi the representives are very kind and friendly and the shopping experience is excellent Thank You! Sincerely, Emmanuel Silva\\nI think it was awesome. I got to see what employers are looking for in the current job market as well as learned what information was relevant to put on my resume.\\nGlobus as usual did a Great Job.  My wife and I had a fantastic vacation.  We traveling around the island and seen waterfalls, icebergs, geysers, whales and glaciers just to name some of the sights we seen.  The hotels were nice and clean if not fancy since I doubt there were five star hotels available.  The guide was local and knew what she was talking about.  To summarize this is a fantastic vacation which I would totally recommend.\\nBest price found.  Easy to use.  Hotel was exactly as advertised.\\nHana was really kind to help me. \\nI am very pleased with her service. \\nI look forward to my journey. \\nThank you.\\nI concerned about the perishabikity of such decadent splurge.  It was received perfectly packed and on time.  OLMA reached out throughout  the process.  Thrilled with the product as well as the entire experience.\\nAwesome service, I placed my order on Sunday and received the item in Canada by Wednesday. I highly recommend Planet Express for forwarding service.\\nA couple of years ago, I bought a really nice HP Envy all-in-one printer. It worked really well until over a couple of weeks, its control panel went completely dead. No display, no buttons, no controls, nothing!\\n\\nI had a 3-year warranty on the printer from SquareTrade, and I was well within the warranty period, so I called them to find out what to do. After some analysis, they determined the best remedy was to send me a check for my full purchase price, and I received that in less than a week! I\\'m a happy guy!\\n\\nNow I\\'m buying the new printer to replace that Envy. Guess what - it\\'s not another Envy!  And I ordered another 3-year SquareTrade warranty with that new printer! I look forward to my secure future with SquareTrade!\\nI had spent at least ten years researching and checking out gutter protection services for our home. After numerous \"Home Shows\" and In-Home demonstrations, I selected a winner. Fortunately, my painstaking research and patience has paid off well. The Leaf Filter gutter protection system has performed exceptionally well. It has handled the Midwest winters over the past couple of years and continues to perform as promised. When I have gone up on the roof, which has been much less since installation of the system, I do check out the system and it still looks as good as it did on the day it was installed. I have recommended the system to numerous individuals and will continue to do so.'"
