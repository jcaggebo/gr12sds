Because you are cloning a Github repository that only we can push to, you should **NEVER EDIT** any of the files you pull from Github. Instead, what you should do, is either make a new notebook and write your solutions in there, or **make a copy of this notebook and save it somewhere else** on your computer, not inside the `sds` folder that you cloned, so you can write your answers in there. If you edit the notebook you pulled from Github, those edits (possible your solutions to the exercises) may be overwritten and lost the next time you pull from Github.

When they had a question about delivery, they called me within minutes of placing the order.  The order arrived on time within days.  All good.\\nFast delivery very easy to order and find books\\nLeagueApps has been a great partner from day one for us.  We are a large travel baseball organization and we love how they have streamlined our registration process and created our website for our families.  What makes them standout from all the others is that they continue to develop products that we have discussed that would help our organization.  Their customer service is TOP NOTCH -  We all joke in our organization that JAKE from LeagueApps is my super hero!!!  We have continued to grow our company with their software and support\\nGreat experience after a horrible one with Art Van.  Thanks much because I have been pleased from talking to Austin to the delivery of my furniture.  Your team did a great job keeping me updated and reminding me of delivery date and time.  I appreciate the effort put in to servicing me.  I definitely will be coming back to purchase again.\\nI had multiple contacts with Summer In Italy.  All were very positive.  The responses I received, even late in the day, were very prompt and complete.\\n1000bulbs has a great selection of all sorts of bulbs and good education links, too.  I haven\\'t received the bulbs I ordered yet so can\\'t review how long it takes to get an order.  I sent my order 2 days ago, received a confirmation quickly, but the rather small order has not shipped yet.\\nI just wanted to let you know how happy you made my daughter\\'s 5th grade basketball team.  The team was recently invited to a State competition in WI.  Since we would spend the weekend with the team, the mom\\'s made each player a \"treat bag\".  Our contribution was to add these unique and fun water bottles that we made from My Own Labels.  WOW THEY WERE A HIT. The girls just got a kick out of seeing their names on the bottle.  The parents and grandparents loved it as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank You\\r\\nLola Bearder.....A very happy 5th grade players mom\\nThis is the 2nd time I\\'ve ordered from Words Anywhere for my office.  I\\'ve used my \"words\" to designate all of our conference rooms on an inside wall.  We even created some inspirational phrases for key areas of our work space.  It\\'s very easy to design creations, they came quickly and they are very easy to apply! Will absolutely continue to order from here.\\nyou always get your order, but they\\'re slow\\nThey tell you one thing and some under the table and it\\'s something else when you get ready to sign your contract they promised you money at a certain time rebate and they don\\'t give it to you all kinds of excuses\\nI have used BookRenter a few times, and each time I receive my books much earlier than the estimated delivery date. I will continue to use them!\\nOrdering from Tailor4Less was a very straight-forward experience, my shirts arrived in a timely manner and they were better value overall than ready-made shirts I used to buy a Nordstrom. They are a better fit too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am partial the French-cuff shirts, but finding them to fit my frame is next to impossible - I just don\\'t have the time to search.\\r\\n\\r\\nTailor4Less fills a big void for me when I am looking for new shirts; they have a good variety of fabrics and patterns with a great fit being custom, in addition to saving me gasoline going to a store - they are delivered to your door!\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Morris\\r\\nSan Pablo, California\\nThe recipes are great! The problem is with the distribution center.  I have repeatedly recieved the wrong meals or missing items in my order.  This has happened at least 3-4 times.\\nEasy to do business with. Quick delivery and great online catalog of parts.\\nThis is the secind worse online experience I\\'ve had. It took 11 days for the order to come and then it wasn\\'t complete. How can a pajama set come separately? Still waiting for the top and I ordered this set early enough to be able to wrap and resend for Christmas. I called customer service only to be told they don\\'t know anything because they are a contract customer service. I will NEVER order from Cafe Press again!\\nThe majority of the books I purchased were in great condition. Almost new!\\nThe whole process was quick and easy. I stated what I was looking for and they made an acceptable reply. Thanks.\\nI love my dress but it came with missing jewels. Otherwise very beautiful.\\nI never heard of AirTkt until my girlfriend referred me to them. I booked tickets for a round trip flight for what I thought was an excellent price. When I checked my E-Ticket, the date for the round trip was off by one week. Don\\'t know if that was their fault or mine, but I\\'m guessing it was me. \\n\\nMore importantly, I called them up and within an hour they rectified the error and my flights were both scheduled on the correct date. In addition, they were very friendly and polite.\\nGreat site for job seeking\\nWill be ordering again.\\nVIP provide an easy to use service that is very cost effective. Particularly like the fact they only take a deposit on booking not the full amount like most companies. Used several times with excellent results, but on last occasion the rental company provided a small SUV when a large one was booked; annoying at the end of a 10 hour flight.\\r\\nOverall would definitely continue using VIP and would recommend to anyone.\\ni wold recommend this company to anyone\\nIt was very easy to order on-line and very fast delivery. Thank you and Merry Christmas.\\nVery disappointed. I was told that someone will call to schedule an appointment to deliver but that never happened. After not hearing from anyone in weeks I called and they schedule an appointment. My delivery came and cabinets was discolored, damaged, not painted in areas, missing parts and doors. I called and was told it was on back order and I have not received anything yet. It’s been weeks. No one followerd up with me. On top of that they left a cabinet on the porch. Once my contractor started putting up cabinets he noticed three different area of cabinets space is either to small to fit all cabinets  or to big for the cabinets to fit from the beginning to end of the wall.  The space was measured by the company twice. She came out to check measurements. At this time I have no answers. No one has returned my calls and I still don’t have my missing parts. Don’t get any cabinets  from here if have had read these reviews before I purchased you cabinets. I would have ran fast! But a friend recommended this place so I went off of her experience.\\nI would recommend this service to anyone. Great prices and honest.\\nExcellent service no matter where in the world I am.  I recommend it to anyone.\\nLoved how easy the website is to order from.\\nLots of choices for what I wanted  and fast shipping!\\nGreat customer service, prices are great also.\\nInformative, polite. Honest. Great experience\\ngreat bundle great value  love it\\n1. I didn\\'t receive any tracking information for one of my book which was bad service, though after mailing they replied and this part of services were good.\\r\\n2. I found my book in letter box in bended form. It is very annoying to read from that book. :(\\nI had an problem with my domain registration so I contacted hostinger staffs for assistance and I have never done a better thing the issue was resolved within minutes I didn\\'t even remembered that I had a problem. Hostinger is the best web host with their professional staffs I would recommend them to anyone that\\'s looking for a great website hosting experience.\\nI was terrified of the refinance process and all it would involve.  James and Michelle walked me through every step.  Best experience ever!  Would highly recommend their service to anyone!\\nVery good company.\\nAn excellent company, things are always arriving as promised and in good condition. I spoke with a representative from the company, she was most helpful. I will buy from this company again.\\nBest prices out of all flights!!\\nSo happy with the purchase, exactly as expected. Bright and beautiful.\\nI\\'ll definately order from them again.\\nIt’s the best learning experience you can have, and is very fun to learn and I highly recommend it to anyone\\nFast shipping, good protective packaging & Really great quality products!\\nthis is the second time I have ordered these night gowns and I love them they are so comfortable and wash up nicely with out shrinking\\nThe Tech that showed up was great , curtious & informative .Would recommend for a great company. Thank you\\nNo overbookings and always had my room ready.\\nStuart was polite and very helpful, answered all my questions.\\nI was excited to receive my parcel, and it arrived punctually. The peace I had that first night was so welcome! And it got me into the habit of sleep, which has since meant I don\\'t always have to use them- but I take them everywhere just in case! So sleeplessness is not a common event now in my life.\\nI have been very satisfied with the company, product, and shipping associated with all my orders.  I sincerely hope the food that I\\'ve ordered is never used in my lifetime; that my reason for ordering never materializes.  But, even though I\\'m hoping for the best, I\\'m trying to prepare, as best I can, for the worst.  I\\'m buying \"insurance,\" in the hope I will never need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I\\'m 100 percent sure, the food ordered will not be wasted, as my kids and grandkids will be able to use the extra cushion... I will be ordering more as time and money are available.\\ninteresting sight....i just hope the cards work..as i am giving them as gifts\\nAfter booking a last minute trip tonAtuna, I realized my passport was expired. Googled rushmy passport, followed the directions and within 10 days I had my new passport. I didn\\'t have to even think twice about the process, the application and didn\\'t wait in a single line. Easiest thing I did all year... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\nI first started doing this to make a few dollars and keep busy since I just retired, however; since I\\'ve started I realize just how important that this is! If you just fly though it you will not take anything away from it, but if you read it all you will get it just like I have. Keep them coming and please stay very interesting.\\nI was happy with my order and will use Overnight Prints again when I need more business cards.\\nExcellent promotional tool.  The letters are embedded into the pen which is also a flashlight and do not rub off.  A good quality pen/flashlight promo tool and reasonably priced.\\nnot happy that when I called customer service on Dec 23 they were closed.\\nSend their orders on time,get rewards,and coupons\\nwhen I return then I will give you my honest review.\\nQuality product at the right price.  And fast shipping too.\\nHotel had no heat on first day.  I called the front desk and they told us it was turned off for the summer.  It must have been 30 degrees in the room due to air conditioner being set on low.  I caught a cold and was sick for three days and loss my voice.\\nWorked easily\\nI installed the phrases today and I am so happy with the results! It wasn\\'t hard at all and the end results are awesome. The ordering was easy and the package came in great time. I\\'m so happy!\\nshirts are the best, and when something doesn\\'t fit perfect, the response is fantastic and replacement for free\\nComplianceSigns has just the signs we needed for our campground!\\nPrintPPS was great from the first contact point to the last. Their customer service and design department were able to check my files and confirm that what I wanted is what I was going to get. The order printed and shipped exactly when they said it would. They work closely with UPS that I knew where my package was and when I should expect. They are a very professional group that I feel confident about recommending and I would definitely use them again.\\nRENT A STORE TO STORAGE MART # 2101 AT 250 FLANAGAN WAY, SECAUCUS, NJ, 07094.

It is the tale of a murderer and Manconi,  the Italian inventor of the wireless transmitter.   Excellent work,   very informative and a great deal of detail about life during that time......fun reading.\\nThe web site is efficient, fast and user friendly.\\nI received my order fast and everything was perfect.\\nI have ordered multiple times from Thrift Books and have never been disappointed.  I am especially pleased with the Large Print selection. I have ordered Large Print on Amazon, only to receive regular sized print, impossible for the visually impaired to read.  This has NEVER happened with Thrift Books!  I cannot recommend this seller highly enough.\\nI wished they add again .com.br\\nI have bought several items and I have been highly satisifed.  The experience has always positive from start to finish.\\nSimple process and reasonable price.

Maybe you find exactly a game which suites your taste. I did.\\nGreat company\\n\\nBeen buying from them for several years now- they have great deals, and a fairly good selection of games. They have a great website- their new site it much easier to navigate, and looks much cleaner. I would highly recommend them to anyone.\\nSo happy with our kitchen faucet.  Exactly as expected from the website.  Easy and fast delivery.\\nI called looking for help resurrecting my old vaporizer and left with a fabulous brand new one. I couldn\\'t be happier. In all honesty, while I am on a budget, I really didn\\'t enjoy using my old one even when it was new so I was pretty excited to get a replacement! After chatting with the associate and sharing how I would love to have a Volcano, he pointed me to one that is similar and not nearly as pricey. It arrived super fast which is always a plus. It was a great suggestion and I\\'ve enjoyed all of the accessories that it comes with.\\nYou made a lifetime customer.\\nReally enjoy using typeform!\\nAll the best with it\\nIt was very quick and easy, Thanks,\\nGreat experience and faster process in Send Money to India! It has been transferred in short time (within 2 hours.)\\nGot a $5.00 credit after spending over $2000 my first month. I was going to continue to do business with them but probably ends after receiving my last order/shipment. I got a KD Signed Basketball that had a smeared autograph. I was corrected and they said it was \"Smudged\" lol. I said, why wasn\\'t it in the description? The reply, well it shows in the picture. I was bidding on like 4 other basketballs and could\\'ve paid a little more for the same thing without the \"Smudge!\" I DIDN\\'T ask for a refund or return. I asked for a credit since I would be ordering a lot of items to finish my man-cave, give out gifts, and trades with my collector friends. But hey, I guess, my business means nothing to them...Or, maybe $5 bucks! Hope you guys hire a real manager in your customer service department that thinks long haul for repeat customers.\\nDavid handled my case in a very professional and kind mattered. He made a situation that has been bother me possible to overcome and made me feel okay with taking steps to resolve my financial situation.

The only complaint was that I had a hard time contacting someone by phone to place an order.\\nI ordered this dress for senior prom. The dress fit just as is said, but is very long. The dress also came right on time, in just 5 days. I would definitely recommend this website to anyone!\\nI was looking for an online marketplace to purchase a Pokemon cosplay costume for my little one and that\\'s where I discovered MIC Costumes. They have an excellent collection of costumes available in the store and I was impressed with it. I could easily find what I was looking for in their store. The order was placed in a couple of minutes and I am waiting till they deliver it to my home. If you want cosplay costumes, this is the place to shop.\\nShipping was fast came with an herb container and a nice grinder. I got the flowermate v5X and couldnt be happier\\nI recomend Economycarrental because they helped me very well with my problem. The refund was made very quickly.  The duration from the first contact till the refund was just one month, what was very fast.\\nreally I\\'m appreciate. \\n\\nThanks a lot\\nMy hands are extremely dry as a side effect of chemotherapy.  I have tried several hand moisturizers recommened to me and none gave me more than a few hours of relief.  I purchased a tube of hand lotion from Premier expecting some relief with Dead Sea minerals.  It didn\\'t happen.  The lotion was no better than others at one-third the price.\\nAptly named!  You don\\'t get this kind of service anywhere today.  Best price, easy ordering and fast painless delivery.  I am extremely satisfied.\\r\\nBecause I believe there is no such thing as perfection, I\\'ve never rated anything or anybody with 5 STARS.  You guys come the closest!\\nFound the exact case I was looking for, decent price, easy ordering, and arrived pretty quickly. Case was just as shown and described, I love it!\\nDas was curtious and worked on cleaning up my computer. It uploads faster.\\nI was very satisfied with the price of the product and the timeliness of receiving the product!\\nHandy maid decided to sweep rugs instead of vacuum, which i found very odd. After vacumming rugs when she left I found they were very dusty based on what was in the vacuum. Didn\\'t dust all the furniture as asked. Cleaned only portions of the tub and floor (only what I would see on first glance). As an example, there was residue left in a couple corners of the tub, instead of cleaning them she put shampoo bottles on top of them. Also, instead of mopping underneath the plunger she mopped around it, which was also odd as it\\'s rather easy to pick up a plunger to mop underneath. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, she mopped but didn\\'t scrub at all so dirt marks were still there. Overall it was pretty half-assed, but I guess you get what you pay for.\\nVery rarely can an online purchase be performed as well as Amazon. However, these guys are one of the few that can pull it off.  Exceptional for obtaining hard to find refills at very reasonable prices with very quick turn-around. I consider them one of my trusted vendors.\\nThe order when it arrived already he one orange that mildew and they really pretty all over ripe when recieved.\\nAceable is a great program. It was a easy, convienent, and fun way to take drivers ed. I highly recommend Aceable, it\\'s awesome!\\nI don´t have words\\nAlways great customer service and fast delivery. Marine part source is always my first stop for maintenance items for my Crusader engines.\\nWhy do you keep sending requests for reviews and do nothing to follow through with resolution of problems? There is a disconnect somewhere.\\nExtremely disappointed.  We are quite used to taking measurements, and ordered according to chart.  The dress is not just tight, it will not even zip.  Far too small.  Her ballet mistress even got the same measurements when she measured for costumes, and they fit perfectly.  PromGirl Customer Service said the chart comes from the designer.  Larger sizes are out of stock and we could not get it here quickly without extreme charges.  We will not be using your website again.\\nID Wholesaler made sure we got our last minute order shipped and received by the dates we needed. Great Customer Service!\\nQuick and easy to use\\nThis company is earnest and explains why they reach their decisions. I believe I  got a good deal they also made recommendations where I  can find other resources. I will consult with them on other items.\\nI needed to purchase nice church bulletins for our Advent and Christmas season and no longer have a local store to get them. I have tried an other Church Supply store not too far away, but would still have to order from and they would either not have much in stock or seem to \"forget\" my order. I checked out Concordia online and found some very nice bulletins for what I was needing, a few clicks and I had every one of my bulletins ordered and paid for online and they arrived so quickly it really surprised me. I also got everything that I ordered too, nothing \"on back order\"\\nHonestly the good was delicious but slightly expensive.  My husband and I are retired and money is a little tight.\\nHi, it took a while for the leaves to fall, but used it yesterday. The cyclone rake is wonderfull. I could not believe how well it worked. I up graded to the deck adapter, it fit like a glove. Jeff\\nYou guys are doing great job but you are slow in preparing shipments. Also the wholesale of bulk orders are expensive and they the prices is not really close to a wholesale price.\\nI purchased a window regulator dorman part # 740-889 when i receivedit i found out it was boxed wrong there for the wrong part. I attempted to contact parts geek and was unable to, i finally got an email telling me to ship the item at my expense back to them and wait 30 days for a refund. so i contacted dorman direct and they took care of the problem. I am an auto repair shop owner and buy several thousand dollars a month on parts,  this was only the third time i tried parts geek and will never buy from them again. please BEWARE of this company they don\\'t seem to care about there customers!\\nlove this store. started shopping here when I started going to cancer center. if I got a good report I got a new outfit. now I treat myself more often.\\nSite is easy to use, payment came quickly.  Very satisfied.\\nI had a great experience, I was approved fast and everything worked out just fine.\\nI like this company my wig came fast I\\'m very satisfied\\nbooked a flight, realized straight after that you can\\'t use special characters, so a guy cancelled it for me and straight after i booked another flight correctly. The next day i found out the guy cancelled the wrong reservation. i spoke with \"Sarah\" who tried charging me an extra $50 per ticket. It was probably thee worst experience I\\'ve ever had with a customer service representative. She raised her voice and told me it was my fault. I realized i was not getting anywhere with her and asked to speak to her supervisor. She came back 10 mins later and told me she would do this one time for me. like if she was doing me the favor. All and all i still asked to speak with  higher authority and again gave me attitude about that. \\n\\nEvery other team member i spoke with was nice and friendly and gave me no issues!\\n\\nWell that was my experience.\\nIt is the perfect purse size. I love the Sunday - Saturday format.  The day space is adequate for my needs.

I love that you guys sent me the tracking number so i can keep up with my order.\\nEasy ordering,prompt delivery\\nGreat pricing compared to other online sites.\\nI never shop online because I always end up ordering the wrong size or I just don\\'t like it when it come in. This sizes are exactly what they say and everything looks exactly like it does it the pictures. I just completed my 4th order.\\nA three only because I had a credit of 39.95 and they changed my checking account for 36.91, why? Now I have to wait for that money to get back into my account, I only leave so much money in there , it made my account short for my Meds. it takes to long for the money to be replaced. But overall I love your shoes, need more 2in. heels. Thanks for reading this\\neDreams = eNightmares HHVETE Confirmed booking eDreams reference number: 3036052208\\n\\nKindly before booking any ticket on eDreams, try to check it on the airline provider website and book it from there better, otherwise your dream trip could turn into a real nightmare.\\n\\nI booked 3 tickets on eDreams, and we got an immediate confirmation, and I also did online check in and got the boarding pass, the airline was vueling, and on the gate we got rejected and the reason was that the payment didn\\'t go through for technical error, and the only way for us to get on the plane is to go immediately to vueling office to do the payment, and that was in Barcelona airport, so we ran all the way to their offices but it was already to late and the gate was closed, and they confirmed to us 100% that the payment didn\\'t go through and thats the reason. then we booked a new flight and traveled and ignored the bad experience.\\n\\nLater, by 2 weeks, eDreams somehow decided to charge the amount like if nothing had happened! so we contacted them and they said its vueling fault and you should claim the money from them, we went to vueling they said the same and we should claim it from eDreams. So they took us in a loop which in my opinion has the same attitude of pirates! we had to chase them down for 2 month till finally eDreams admitted their mistake and agreed to refund the money. After 2 weeks we got the money missing almost 30%, and when we asked why? they said 30% service charge!!! what kind of service is that? We have been forced on the gate not to board the flight, we ran in the airport right and left and still missed the flight, we have been charged after the app failed to make the booking right, we have been fighting and chasing them to get the money back, so how come you could justify the service fees?\\n\\nWhen I asked them to act responsible for their system failure, they acted arrogant that we are very proud of our operator and sorry  we won\\'t refund the balance.\\n\\nAnyway, I just wanted to share the story with everyone to take care, and my advice after this experience book your flight direct from the airlines, and use dreams just for exploring the options, but never give your credit card detail nor do a booking on their system.\\nThe part was ordered on a Sunday night.  PartsGeek sent out notification to FedEx on Monday.  FedEx picked it up on Tuesday.  The part was not delivered until the next Tuesday!!!  We were very unhappy about the shipping time!!!!\\nIn the few months I have been dealing with the Easy Comforts people I have had no problem with any of the products so I have no real reason to deal with a problem with them on that front.  I do however have a real problem when it comes to their website and getting help with that.  Ordering is no problem but trying to figure out how to make a payment online is a real problem and no one has helped me with that yet.\\nI would recommend purchase of any equipment from Ingram\\'s.

However i have since been charged a further £28 taxes.  I appreciate Taxes need to be paid, but DONT say they are included if you then intent to deceive the customer and not include them.  This is very disapointing.  I contacted custoemr support, who \\n said that the \"shipping and Taxes\" ESTIMATOR is only an estimate and that actually it does not inlcude taxes anyway.  On being told thsi is suggested they change the web page to a more honest description but was told that this would loose them sales as it would make them too expensive so they would therefore not be doing that.  \\n\\nAs a busines they have lied and deceived me as a customer, they have quoted something that is \"included\" and have not followed through with your written contract.  You can be assured that i will not purchase from them again following this disastrous lack of support\\nBooked a trip and clicked the wrong date (1 week later) for my return flight. Immediately called JustFly and they charged me $150 to change anything. If it would have been over 24 hours they would have charged me $486 to cancel. Not right in my eyes.

Only issue was the outdated computer system was slow and locked up too often.\\nWorks very well\\nI  was not exactly sure which A/C blower motor I needed so I called Dyers (2006 Monaco Dynasty with two 15K Dometic/Penguin heat pump units). Their technical sales people made sure the motor I needed was the one they sold me. It was delivered fast and with the included installation instructions which were easy to follow, it probably took about 2 1/2 hours from start to finish to remove the old and install the new. It works great and is nice and quite - thanks Dyers!\\nEverything worked as advertised\\nYou order wine at reasonable prices, explore, taste, make notes and if you don\\'t like it, they make it good with a bottle you like.

No Hassel. Great item.\\nRequested car very early in the morning. Car arrived on time. Driver was very careful during early morning traffic. I highly recommend.\\nSee above brief review\\nThis is a preliminary review as I am still in the Medical Billing Specialist program, but the videos are not well organized, the slides have typos and the pictures in slides aren\\'t clear to see and often not relative. The woman in the videos is so redundant, often saying the same thing three different ways in a matter of minutes. The videos make mention of terminology that is never spelled or is not even a vocabulary word, which I find ridiculous.  This is an anatomy class and if you are going to talk about it don\\'t assume the learner knows anything about what it is that you are saying. The book is not helpful at all. At the end of the chapter there are vocabulary words and next to them pages where the word was discussed. Well when you go to that page you simply find the word with a line next to it where a definition is to be inserted. Basically, they never define the word.\\n\\nI am highly disappointed and find it hard to even get motivated to work through this program. It is torturous to me.\\nAlways love LTS - the only clothes that really fit me!\\nWe were looking for a great place to build our business and reputation. We found this fantastic office located in the lower section of wall street. It provides a spactacular view and some of the greatest customer support I have ever witnessed.

Even after receiving part orders, \\'live chats\\' with an IdealShape CSR the resolution has been poor.  (The CSR did great, but his hands are tied by poor decisions/planning from others in the company).  As  much as we like the product, we are looking to switch to another as we simply cannot count on the distribution.\\nI recently gave this company a try and found that the call quality is good, prices are good and unlike a calling card your balance is added to your next order.  Easy and fast very happy customer\\nI\\'ve been a customer for over 10 years and have always been extremely satisfied.  I\\'ve never experienced anything negative and have recommended SFHerb Co to family and friends.  I look forward to many more years of great service and great products, specifically the teas I order several times a year.  Looking forward to someday visiting in person, but for now am very happy with online ordering.\\nI\\'ve done 5 transactions so far with them and they are always quick and painless. A+++\\nThey have an idiotic address system in which a package that has been sent from abroad, when reaching the destination country, is relabeled with a different address (whatever address the same customer had used in the past), although the package itself contained, from the origin, a different address.\\n\\nSo instead of receiving the package directly to Address X in Town X, they sent the delivery guy to Address Y in Town Y, just because in the past I received a package to that Address Y. \\n\\nThey had my phone all the time, and could have contact me first if there were any doubt about the address.\\n\\nIt simply makes no sense, and it\\'s the most idiotic system I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nGo to FedEx next time, or DHL. They work more with their brains, than UPS.\\nFast, easy and affordable\\nNice job, quick shipping, product came as ordered.  Way to go!\\nGreat variety of books from art to zoology!  All available at a terrific price and I have yet to get one (even if it lists condition as \"acceptable\") that wasn\\'t in much better shape than the used bookstore we used to have in town.  thank you Thriftbooks for helping me indulge my reading habit without breaking the bank!\\nEasy booking and transparent overview\\nOrdered and paid for pump on Friday. Was told one day delivery. Didn\\'t come Saturday or today. (Monday)  plumbers were here today but had to send them home.\\nI live in hotels for work during the week so it\\'s worth my while to use priceline to save money. Sometimes it\\'s super easy and sometimes it takes a while.\\nI had 2 instances in which I had to call priceline and the first time was very difficult. The second time was a piece of cake. Inconcistant but oh, well, it saves per diem!\\nI had a very intuitive representative who went the extra mile to help me get what I wanted in my trip.   After telling her in detail what my wants and needs were she asked a co-worker who just came back from a trip to Dominican Republic, where and how was the Hotel she stayed in.    I am very happy and pleased to say it was a perfect vacation with all my needs and wants granted!!!!\\nQuick check out it waseasy\\nIt was easy to read through and I had plenty of time to answer questions.  Just follow directions and it goes by fast.\\nWe owed the IRS for a mistake we made.  We contacted Optima and they stepped in and handled the issue with a professionalism that is hardly ever seen today.  We were able to talk with real people whenever we wanted and they kept us up to date with each step.  Contact with the IRS was limited to normal notices with none of those threats of collections or other actions.  Our issue was solved in a manner way better than we expected.\\nI required an article in a journal to which I don\\'t subscribe. Easy process to access and price  was reasonable.\\nI think it was very informative I learned a lot that I did not know about boating give you a five stars\\nSuper easy to use. Made booking a flight quick.\\nhope it lives up to the reviews\\nAs always Enterprise customer service is stellar\\nIn spite of FedEx taking a week to deliver my plants, they arrived in good shape, excepting the Sedum that will probably recover.  That says all you need to know about plant quality from Bluestone.  Next time, try USPS.\\nThe product arrived very quickly but I feel like it should have been packed with a cold pack. I ordered probiotic and on the infant formula, it clearly says to keep refrigerated. Other suppliers have always sent it with a cold pack so I am a little concerned that it lost potency in the hot travel here.\\nThe did not end up buying my book which I understand.  They cannot purchase every textbook sent their way.  But what I am disappointed in is that I have to PAY them to get my book back.  Their policy regarding books not purchased was not easily found.  It should be made clear and easy to find when trying to sell textbooks to them.  Seller beware.\\nTop notch service and out of this world products !\\nWalter Drake has very good items to choose from.\\nI\\'ve purchased a couple of watches from Jomashop. Both instances featured FAST shipping (as in receiving the products within 2 days), well packaged products, with expected touchpoints (email receipts, when it shipped, tracking, etc).

We forgot a jacket on the van.  When we called to see if they found it, they already had it and promised to hold it until our return.  They even offered to come back to the airport to deliver it before our flight left.\\nDon\\'t waste your money or time. I bought a part for my car and got a broken part after waiting 4 days. This is for my main car I use to drive to school and couldn\\'t. I called and they have good constomer service. I got a replacement and received a faulty part.  I found out after I got it installed in my car. It\\'s not even a OEM part. Which the website promises. Don\\'t waste your time and money. There constomer service hours are terrible and it feels like I can\\'t get in touch with the company. They need to start checking the parts the junk yards are sending because they are sending bad parts  and cheap parts.\\nI opt for PRINCE 2 Online Classroom Flexi-Pass course & found to be very convenient and helpful. Trainers were very well experienced in sharing & teaching with real time examples which was really helpful to understand at beginner level. The very special thing from this organisation is providing the class recording which really helps to enhance & understand the topics at later stages. Also the trainers are providing the special notes prepared during the online class. Overall experience was great & awesome..\\nVery friendly easy to talk with agent.  Throughly explained everything I needed to understand.

Worst company to buy from .\\nThe dress look amazing on me great quality and fast delivery. Great service.\\nI had booked my flight ahead of time and later had to switch my dates due to an emergency. I was told that I would have to cancel which will then result in me being charged and then I had to book for a new flight. Luckily Ashton came to my rescue. He made every easy to work with and his customer skill is very sharp.\\nVery happy with my company choice- timely and exactly as listed\\nGot a broken gun that was poorly packaged and then had to email for a return, they didn\\'t pick up when I called, getting a response took a long time, I always had to email and ask for updates because they left me in the dark, and the return process took way too long.\\nI ordered a book weeks ago. I haven\\'t received yet. I paid us$11 dolars for shipping to Canada e guess what. the tracking number I received doesn\\'t work outside of USA. No one knows where my book is. I staterd school weeks ago and the book i ordered i desperately need it right now.\\r\\n Bookbyte doesn\\'t have a phone number for customer service that I can call.\\r\\n They only have this online chat where you keep getting copy and paste messages. no one really knows and care about what\\'s going on. terrible customer service. I will not use bookbyte services ever again!!\\nLove everything I have ordered, shipped in timely manner and customer service is very nice.\\nMy rep researched all options completely and always put my objectives and interests first. She was totally reliable, honest and followed through on everything. She was the best advisor I ever had making me feel completely comfortable with my choices, her company and her services. I would never do this investment from a website except from her and her company\\nExcellent tickets\\nI ordered a Samsonite suitcase from Suitcase.com.  The particular model I ordered was no longer produced by  Samsonite and I was offered a better more expensive suitcase for the same price.  Emails sent to suitcase.com were attended to the same day if not sooner!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuitcase delivered on time.\\nI was looking for a last minutes flight to visit my parents and was shopping around. JustFly had the best prices and schedules for flights I was looking for.\\nThe item came so fast after the order was placed, item was in grear condition-brand new, and very pleased with customer service trying to locate what we needed online!\\nThis process could not have been easier, it took about 3 hours total over a period of two days to have everything complete. I recommend having all of your bills and statements ready to go before you call to make the process easier for you.\\n\\nThe representative that helped me, Josh, was so kind and friendly throughout the entire process. When he said he would call me back, he did. When he said he would email me something, he did. I was so impressed with the level of customer service I received. \\n\\nAdditionally, I was contacted by Jim a few days later to welcome me to the program.

However, the shipping and handling charge was exorbitant, almost as much as the 3 hats.  This charge will adversely effect any future purchase I might consider.\\nFriendly people that treated me and my time with respect. Funds were delivered quickly and the process was smooth. Would recommend and use again for sure.\\nI ordered a Rolex from these guys and it was awesome. I actually called up to see if i would be receiving my watch by new years eve and they told me to hang in there. The next thing i know, i got an email saying it was being shipped overnight to make sure i got in time for my new years eve party. Awesome Job and an awesome website. This is my second Rolex i\\'ve bought from them and will not go anywhere else.\\nI\\'ve bought, sold, and rented books from Bookbyte over the past two years with good results. My most recent order of a used book with expedited shipping arrived promptly and looked new! Their website is well organized and their prices are competitive. I have found Bookbyte to be a trustworthy and reliable vendor.\\nQuick simple and great way to save money over an ordinary hotel booking.\\nExcellent...not disappointed at all.\\nGreat to do business with everything arrive perfectly\\nGreat service and speedy funding\\nThis is the second year in a row I have ordered my fundraiser tickets through them.

Still after approx 1 month, waiting for the package to come.\\n\\nSo in brief all is good and well with dx.com, but only order goods that you are not in need in next 1 or 2 months.

Just as often, the seats are terrible even being a Red Velvet member.\\nChristmas Eve: With friends & family staying with us for the holidays we placed an order online for local restaurant. Grubhub charged me for food, gave delivery time and sent a confirmation email with “tracking” link.\\nWe waited. I checked via their tracking tool and the delivery time had not changed even when the order was 30 minutes late. I then checked Grubhub online and was instructed to call the restaurant. Restaurant has excellent reputation and track record for excellent service and food. Restaurant informed me that they are not affiliated with Grubhub and were closing soon. I then called Grubhub back. Agent contacted restaurant and gave me the only information she could find, “we had been charged and our order would not be coming”.\\nImagine having to scramble for something to cook and serve our guests for a Christmas Eve dinner. To add insult to injury it was my father’s 92nd birthday and he was excited for dinner from one of favorite restaurants.\\nI called Grubhub on 12/26 and was told my money would be refunded in 3-5 business days. Is this a Grubhub scam to use customers money interest free? Agent at Grubhub would not let me speak with Manager/supervisor and told me Manager had told me to not use Grubhub anymore! I asked again and for a second time I was told that a Manager would not talk to me and I should not use Grubhub.\\nBuyer beware! This company charges customers when no service is provided, charges for nothing and has the worst customer service I have ever encountered.\\n\\nSignificant compensation is due to me from Grubhub for ruining our Christmas Eve.\\nWould use again\\nIt took 4 tries to complete the reservation.\\nI would definitely recommend sparefoot to anyone.\\nPrompt service and competent staff.\\nI was introduced to Simplilearn by my company. I was a bit skeptical because I wasnt sure how the online learning would be due to its lack of human interaction compared to that of the classroom versions. But I was wrong. They have a 24/7 support that can help you whenever you are stuck in a course. The details and dept of information of the courses give you a holistic view of the entire topic. You end up getting deep insights into the said topic. I took a course of Digitial Marketing Certified Associate. With a little background in Digital Marketing, I slowly realized that the information given was up to date. They have projects in place too which you can complete with friendly timelines post the completion of your course. The course agenda takes you through the right path from basics to slightly complicated to highly detailed information. The website is fairly fast and the videos load instantly and do not buffer. A great site to do you specialized e-learning.\\nI made a mistake and somehow purchased the wrong saturday. I called them in the 1st 3 minutes and nobody would answer my calls. They had tickets for the proper date, and it would not have been a issue if they would answer the phone. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll I got from them is that all sales are \"final\". Basically go screw off we don\\'t have time for you, and we really thank you for your business :). \\r\\n\\r\\nAngry customer!\\nI talked with someone and was told based on the answers to questions I was asked that I qualified for a loan. I asked for $2500 and I was told I qualified for $4,500 which was great! Well, Jessica Hakenson emailed me to fax my docs so she could deposit the funds. When I did, I had to call repeatedly before I rec\\'d a cb from her. I had to email all my docs to her again. Then, she emailed me at 7:00 am pst to tell me I couldn\\'t have the loan due to my bank act being overdrawn in the month. I have overdraft protection plus another bank. I wasn\\'t even asked what happened. You are not a reputable company. I\\'d hate to think when you saw my driver\\'s license, you changed your mind. I don\\'t believe any positive reviews.\\nThis business model is maddening. It is absolutely ridiculous that if I forget to \"skip the month\", the credit that I receive cannot be applied to sale items. It\\'s marketed like it\\'s a great thing to have a credit, but it\\'s a punishment. I could not wait to use up my credit and then cancel.\\nPretty much satisfied with purchases but shipping is a little high\\nThe cups I ordered came and are of good quality. The imprints are exactlky as I ordered and look very good.\\nWas a bit skeptic, after the product first arrived, but now after using the solar cover for a while, super happy with it!!\\nI requested GPS and the site says that more information will be needed after completing the purchase.  When the purchase is done, it shows terms and conditions spelling that the GPS is delivered in the US --if the trip is scheduled at least 7 days in advance.  Since I am traveling in 2 days, I paid for this but I cannot get it.  Bait and hide.\\nThe agent I spoke with was helpful and efficient.  I also believe that I got the best flights at the lowest price.\\nQueensboro has amazing products and fantastic prices, and their customer service is second to none!\\nPoor unprofessional customer service. \\nDo not value customer\\'s time.\\n\\nThe site is ok so long as you don\\'t have any issues requiring to deal with the customer service. If you have to deal with customer service, be prepared to spend hours with no resolution. Customer service is mainly interested in selling services and charging fee even if it is their fault. They will provide misleading and incorrect information.\\n\\nYou will be better off dealing directly with airlines/hotels or reputed travel sites. \\nIf somebody from the site calls you to help, please be very careful.\\nMy experience with SecurCare was good.  The facility was in decent shape & clean, the staff was helpful, and everything worked.\\nFound a great service, but didn\\'t have a local for another service I need.\\nThe process to book a car was fast and straight forward. I have booked here 3 times so far, with 1 cancellation on my behalf.  There was a fee involved but I guess its understandable. Other times the rental was painless and professional.  Hope it continues as it\\'s a one stop shop that does it for me.\\nit was easy prompt and the clerk was very professional.I recommend this service to everyone.\\nI recommend  the Court yard at the marriott, because they are a 3 1/2 star place and \\r\\nI\\'ve stayed there before.  The staff was very nice and knowledgeable.\\nNo prob a at all\\nThis was my first time ordering from cafepress. My products were delivered promptly and I received email updates (shipping day and expected delivery day) prior to arrival. I will order from Cafepress again.\\nOrdered two weeks ago and still have yet to see order.  Ridiculously slow compared to all other companies.  Will never order again from this company.\\nOur expectations have been met by booking thru priceline.\\nI think this is a very cool site. A lot of the time I am thinking about getting a credit card and I don\\'t know which one to apply for. This site has so many and it helps to read the reviews that other people have written to find out which card I should apply for. I will definitely be using this website in the future. I also like that you can also purchase prepaid debit cards as well as gift cards if you don\\'t want to apply for a credit card. I will also be using that feature as well.\\nI used to go to Supplement Warehouse when I lived in Wisconsin, and because they are such a great company I kept ordering from them after I left the state for the military and was stationed in California. Their shipping is always fast, their selection is huge, and their price match is great! Would recommend to anyone looking for quality supplements at a good price.\\nGreat service, prompt shipping.\\nI will definitely continue to buy from 10dollarmall, everything came on time and fit great. quality is excellent :)\\nOnly place I buy books from - they should relocate the id sticker though from the spine. Maybe inside cover? When you try to take the sticker off it often leaves a bruise.\\nI was very pleased with the feedback I received about my medical problem. The response was quick and thorough.\\nThere good that\\'s all clean and accessible\\nThey arrived quickly, and THEY worked!!\\nBundle Stars always provided me some of the best deals around the Web. It definitely is one of my favorite game provider amongst many others including Steam, Humble bundle and gog!\\n\\nGreat deals, great service, never had the slightest problem with them !\\nI am able to breathe so much easier!! Thank you FDR for giving me the help I needed after some personal hardships and getting my finances in order and putting me back in control!!\\nThis home was very nice, it accommodated our large family with ease. It was very clean and I close to tourist sites.   My only recommendation is to have a big screen installed on the door so the weather can be enjoyed.  Will definitely use again in the future.\\nI buy the box of 12 pairs of these finest ear plugs - no other ear plugs suit me better. \"Ear plugs on line\", offer the best price and postage cost to UK.  They offer a prompt service.\\nBest thing I ever did. \\nI had no idea how much I was missing. \\nGreat company’\\nFun! Expensive, but I think it\\'s worth it at least so far as I\\'m 2 boxes into my yearly subscription.  I\\'m so into it that I wish the boxes came more frequently than once a month.  It\\'s difficult but not so difficult that it\\'s frustrating.  Users need to be careful when researching online because many discussion forums exist with spoilers.\\nI stumbled across www.cafepress in an attempt to find some baby clothes that sported a \"baby bean\" design (the name my son & daughter-in-law have chosen for their second fetus).  The items I ordered came promptly and delighted my children.  I managed to submit multiple duplicate orders so I had to contact customer service.  It was easy to get through, and the representative was helpful and personable.\\nPetFlow is a great site. You can get some really good deals.\\nThis was our first time using a pet sitter through trusted housesitters.  Within a few days of posting our need for a pet sitter, I had several responses and was able to chose the one that I thought would best meet our needs. We had an excellent experience.  Our pet sitter left the house in excellent condition and our pet was happy and content when we returned home.\\nFlawless experience, very happy with the price I paid and the service provided.  I would definitely recommend them and use them again for my own purchases.  Thanks!\\nComes on time, every time.\\n\\nAlso free samples.\\nI joined the freedom debit relief company in at October 2017 with 5 creditors and by December already have a debit wiped OUT very satisfied\\nAlways good service the manager is is a stand up guy\\nThey do what they promise.\\nMy reservation was fast and easy.  I did it online and received my confirmation to my email within minutes.  I\\'ve Tried several online reservation companies and was scammed by one in the past.  I appreciate the fast service and my son and I look forward to traveling home to visit family.  I as a VETERAN don\\'t get many chances to fly home and see my MOM.  Thank you JustFly for the quick and easy reservation.\\nI ordered my stethescope on a thursday and i got it on Saturday. I was very impressed with the fast delivery. The engraving was free, other sites wanted $10. The only thing was that the color of my stethoscope wasn\\'t quite the same as in the picture but it was still nice. I will definitely buy from Medisave again!!\\nEncountered a dirty property and the host agreed to refund 50% on accommodation fees. AirBNB charges a Percentage on the accommodation fee, so I requested a 50% refund of the service fees. They kept saying the host short changed me. Asked me to file a claim against the host! But the monies refunded by the host tallies. It is the service fees that was withheld by AirBNB!\\nVery easy to work with and very fast at getting back to you my experience was excellent\\nI emailed for a quote and Anthony got back to me right away. Throughout the entire process, Anthony was very responsive and helpful. Shipping was fast as well.  I got the natural wood flash drives and they were beautiful with my logo engraved on them! My clients were very happy and impressed with them. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone!\\nBookbyte is a great way to get your textbooks in great condition and for cheap!

I will continue to buy and recommend this site to friends!\\nFast delivery, even here in Hawaii. Product as advertised\\nI am happy.  I used the DrSim service for a Galaxy S8 that was locked to Xfinity  mobile. They emailed me that standard service was not available and had an option for a full refund or they would send a zip file with instructions to unlock by usb cable. I opted for usb  The instructions could of been better; they lack diagrams(screenshots). it probably would be good if DrSim created a YouTube video to complement instructions. They warn you final step can take 20 minutes to get codes to unlock but they don\\'t tell it will be embedded in the program. You expect screen will change displaying the codes but doesn\\'t  the codes show in red Also they indicate \"DeFreeze\" code but actually shows as \"Freeze\" After entering two codes nothing happen so i tried a phone restart and did at one point  think I had bricked the phone as it got locked in a android menu screen. After several  attempts to reboot or power down it remain locked on android menu. I gave up for about hour to find the phone still locked. I was still connected to the program so I just tried rerunning  program and phone rebooted and unlocked.\\nI was impressed with the care and service I received.\\nEveryone was courteous and efficient.\\nI wanted an emergency dentist.

The second box not so much! Felt a little risky spending so much on something I probably wouldn\\'t like! If you\\'re a candy lover you will love this! It\\'s fun and cute! I myself am just a little too picky! I didn\\'t have difficulty cancelling my subscription and the customer service was so pleaseant I almost wanted to keep my subscription just because the rep was so nice!\\nThis is the second time that I have purchased flags from American Flags.\\nI am very pleased with both my purchases. The quality is outstanding, the price is good and delivery is very quick.\\nGreat customer service and quick turnaround!

Product met my expectations.  A touch on expensive side.\\nWell, at first I was getting a mix of whites and reds and I made it clear that I was only interested in reds. And, then I got the reds. But, honestly, I don\\'t care how many points (they were all rated in 90\\'s) the wine gets, some were just not easy to drink. So, I added diet Sprite. Do you really want that to happen? The best thing about your service is the free shipping to my address. Other than that, no so much!\\nLove the heels I purchased cannot go wrong for the price..cannot wait to put them on..I also love that it came so fast too..very good quality..I put it on and for heels they are comfy\\nVery friendly customer service!!

I ordered two items. One came within a week. The other item never arrived. When I contacted the company, I was told that it was backordered but should be out soon. I have NEVER, NEVER, NEVER received this item. What a ripoff of a company. I will blacklist you whenever asked.\\n\\nVery DISAPPOINTED!\\nIt is impossible to earn 500 points watching videos. Most days I can\\'t even earn the daily goal but I really appreciate being able to earn gift cards!\\nWe were just moving apartments from downstairs to upstairs.  We needed help with the big stuff like couches, washer and dryer and such. Booking was super easy and they were very helpful. They told me that the crew would be here between 9-9:30 am, but they showed up at 8am. That was the only negative I could say. Maybe next time call the customer if you’re going to be coming before they’re expecting. Other than that the move went great, crew was very helpful and we accomplished what I was hoping to in the 2 hours we had them.\\nI bought a Groupon voucher and bought the scarves for about $7.50 a piece. The product came in a week and they wrapped it in a very good package. They have a lot of different varieties and colors which make it so hard to choose. The color was beautiful, I bought 4 solid pashmina in different colors and it all came even better from what I expected it. The material is soft and the quality is good. Soon as placed the order, i bought another voucher from Groupon. Now I just place my 2nd order with them. This would be a great Christmas presents. I\\'m looking forward for my second order to arrive. It\\'s definitely worth and i can see myself coming back here in the future. I would recommend those who loves scarves to check this site.\\nGreat stuff!!\\nI dislike traveling since 9/11 but I have to say...my first experience with Long Term Parking made my last trip at least tolerable.  I opted for the Valet parking option and am so glad I did.  I arrived at the lot (easy to find BTW), pulled my car into valet lane, checked-in at the desk and was on the shuttle to the airport in about 5-mins.  I was dropped off at my departure terminal a few mins later and on my way.  Upon getting back, I used the instructions provided to text LTP that I had arrived and was waiting at Terminal A.  Sure enough...a few minutes later, the shuttle arrived to take me back to my car where it was ready and waiting for me.  Another quick check-in/payment at the desk and I was on my way.  Never again will I use the Airport\\'s parking as LTP provides much better service much less cost.\\nthe ear plugs didn\\'t work with my wife snoring in the same bed\\nCaitlyn was super helpful in the decision process for buying a custom engagement ring and made it so I didn\\'t have to worry at all.\\nThe only issue I have is their stickers tear the covers of my books.

This is the best deal I find. Tickets delivery some things to check in the future. Thanks.\\nThese products are as advertised. The powders are like dust they are so fine. Which is better for absorption. I actually like that they don\\'t taste great (everything taste ok). That instills confidence in me that the products are high quality. I like the fact that you can order straight from the manufacturer for only $6 shipping. I\\'m getting the freshest product available. I probably pay 10% more for higher quality products.  I\\'ll take that any day of the week.\\nGreat prices on books and on shipping.  Prompt and reliable.\\nAs a first time customer I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to order a customised necklace! I received discounts and free shipping.

It was so easy to use and I got numerous bids from great transporters to chose from for the lowest price available. Being able to speak directly with my delivery guy while in route was so nice. When you\\'re having a $50,000 boat delivered from Arizona to Ohio it\\'s good to know that things were going smoothly! I will definitely use them again for any other long distance purchases and I suggest you do the same!\\nUsed the service last a year ago. When I recently needed to use again, noticed that the prices went up dramatically. Usually this would correspond with better quality or experience. However neither of those things occurred. In fact call quality was not only worse, but atrocious. The first call I made was unable to connect with person I was calling. However I was still billed for the call. I was able to connect with the second call, but person on the other end couldn\\'t hear me. Overall just pathetic.\\nI was very weary on purchasing a dress from an online site. Especially after hearing so many horror stories.. but after doing lots of research and reading a few reviews on the actual site I decided to go ahead with it. Got my package today. Was shipped from New Jersey. Ordered it on a Thursday night and the dress arrived on Tuesday by UPS. Beautifully and carefully wrapped. Dress came on a hanger and wrapped in plastic! Fun little thank you note inside.  Dress looks just like the pictures and fits true to sizes on size chart! It\\'s so soft! I\\'m thoroughly pleased! Will definitely be ordering from simplydresses.com again!\\n\\nI\\'d also like to add.. this is a 100% unbiased review. I was not compensated in any way to post this.

Not entirely their fault but now dress needs to be returned and I am not entirely certain that I will get my full purchase price back.  Time will tell.....\\nEasy to make a reservation and appreciated the discount!\\nThe parts sent were not correct.  No phone number is provided to contact for customer support.  I had to pay to ship the parts back even though I was not at fault.  I will not order parts from Parts Geek again.\\nI enjoy the part I contribute in each survey.

I have never had an issue with the gift cards sold on Cardpool.  It is the only gift card site that I will buy from now!\\nPlease be VERY careful dealing with this company. The way they handle things is very unprofessional. You\\'ll see below you many positive reviews but you can be sure those have been planted by the company itself. After my own situation with JewelOcean I did an extensive web search and saw the same thing over and over: false positive reviews and here and there real complaints from real customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ordered a necklace early January this year. After over two weeks of silence from the company (no shipping receipt, no UPS tracking number, etc) I had to personally call them to ask what was up. Turns out they hadn\\'t even shipped it because of \"bad weather\". Later I get an email saying according to USPS my package has been lost. I called again and asked for an explanation, and they said \"according to my tracking number, the package is untraceable). I ask for the tracking number to check myself, and the guy gets audibly flustered and starts snapping back at me, changing his story to \"USPS never shipped your package so there is no tracking number\". Everything about this company is super super sketchy, from the Indian guy who always seems to answer my phone calls to the unprofessional emails they send, to the generic positive reviews they seem to get on every site. Just don\\'t order from them, please. Trust me.\\r\\n\\r\\nPS. I never ended up getting that necklace. There goes a planned birthday present.\\nMy experience was great. He was very informative and respectful. I am glad I havecADT home security. I feel secure at home and away from home\\nI wanted to buy a hunch or cards in different amounts. I really would love a ton of the $10 cards. But there aren\\'t a lot of them or there and the $10 cards came as paper instead of actual gift cards. They\\'re the reason I ordered from there in the first place and it didn\\'t work out.\\nQuick, Easy and Convenient. Plus o loft that the repayment ia done with my card on the day its due so its taken out immediately.\\nVery easy process and my niece loved her gift!\\nI bought a house and have opened a new credit card account weeks ago and I still have not been notified????

It\\'s the perfect addition to my office.\\nI have stayed in Priceline rooms many times and almost always get something as good or better than what I expect.  The only down side is the hotels do not treat Priceline guests well, always trying to assign the worst room, or not the size bed requested.  The hotels are mostly good quality and it is very easy to book.  Have never had a problem.\\nThe service was the best you can ask for from time we walk in the door to the time we received our visa . \\r\\nThank you\\nI had an appointment recently for an extraction and a Temporary Bridge. I was received with warm Smiles from the Staff. The atmosphere is very relaxing and calm. Dr. Annette Murphy kept me informed through out the process. The whole process was so comfortable that I lost track of time as I was using the Virtual Movie Glasses.  University Oak Dental is the Best in Town. I recommend that you come to University Oaks Dental. You will Love it.\\nI\\'ve been to the \\'other\\' sac store in the Mall of America many times and my wife and I always leave the store wanting a big comfy sac to lounge in... but the cost just doesn\\'t add up.  I don\\'t mind paying for good products, but there is a point where things are just too expensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did my research online, found Comfy Sacks and after much contemplation I decided if Comfy Sacks are good enough for Amazon/Apple Corp, then they\\'d be good enough for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI chose the 6ft sack with a brown textured premium suede.

I have always been satisfied with everything they have done for us. We have outfitted many of our company trucks with tires at this store and they always do a good job and get our trucks back to us in a timely manner.\\nthanks to your support personnel getting this installed\\nMy wife and I rode from NYC to La Guardia to catch a late morning flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I am using Dial7 a lot, I got their spring coupon on the mail, and used it towards the reservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the driver asked for the coupon, I told him I got it online. I than asked if the coupon was implemented, and got a short and rude answer that it did. So far, not that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the entire process of the checkout was done by the driver. Usually (and I use Dial7 and Carmel A LOT!), the driver just swipes the card, and hands the device to the customer to review the bill, choose the tip amount and to sign. In this case, the driver verbally asked me how much tip I would like to add (made me feel uncomfortable) and just handed me the device to sign without an option to review the bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got the receipt immediately to my phone and looked at it, and saw that although the driver used EZ-Pass on the Triboro bridge (meaning, he paid $5.54), he charged me $8, which is the price if you go through the cash lanes, and therefore, over-charged me for $2.46.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him about it and he snapped at me, calling me cheap and said that all I want is a free ride. I can\\'t even describe the shock I was in to hear those insults, and I told the driver that these accusations are extremely rude, especially to someone who uses this service so many times a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wrongful charge should not be looked individually, because if the driver is over-charging everybody, it sums up to a huge amount of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope Dial7 will get back to me on this matter.\\nCompetitive pricing, convenient locations!\\nProduct is great! Very prompt service, packaged well. Love the look of my new Metal Letters!\\nFound the rates on just fly cheapest.  Booking was a breeze!!

Having never used them before I was tentatively waiting for the items to arrive but I was very happy when they did.  I would definitely use them again and recommend them to others.\\nThe tech Teddy very nice and on point he has good knowledge. I was very empressed.\\ni thought i was charged sales tax and it was shipping my error, sorry to big tall direct the product is fine.\\nWebsite easy to use.  Any problems are solved easily with a phone contact to their customer service center.\\nI ordered some custom journals to be given out during an awards ceremony. My order was supposed to arrive three weeks before the ceremony. A week after the expected arrival date, I logged in to CafePress to see why they hadn\\'t come, and my order showed as cancelled. I didn\\'t get any kind of notification from CafePress that my order had been cancelled.\\n\\nI called CafePress customer service to find out what was up, and I was told the the order had been cancelled because of a suspected copyright violation. I used our organization\\'s logo on the journals, so fair enough, I don\\'t blame them for flagging it. But to not notify me was totally unacceptable.\\n\\nThe customer service representative I spoke to was very pleasant, but she could not do anything to reinstate my order. She said she would put in a ticket to some other group that could and told me they would call me within 24 hours. 24 hours later, no call, so I called back. Spoke to the exact same very nice CSR, who gave me a phone number for this mysterious other group. Called the number, it went straight to voicemail. Left a message with my phone and email. Next day, still no call back. Called again, straight to voicemail again, left another message. No response. \\n\\nSo, totally fed up, I went and ordered the exact same type of journal from Vistaprint, which turned out to be a lot cheaper, even with the expedited shipping I had to pay for in order to get the journals before the ceremony. \\n\\nI will never use CafePress again.\\nEvery time I call the answer all my questions and concerns and are very patient making sure I fully understand whatever I was concerned about.\\nSome of the reservations on the phone are fantastic! Some need some serious training!\\nOne of their cakes was sent to me as a birthday present via FedEx. The driver left it outside the door, and when I retrieved it, there were about 500 ants inside the box, even inside the cheesy plastic wrap for the cake. The only thing to do with it was discard it in the trash. So I cannot comment on the edibility of the cake. However, when I contacted customer service via their web site, I was sent an e-mail telling me to call a customer number. When I did, I was put on hold for about five minutes, when a man came on, asking me what my problem was. When I told him, he put me on hold for another five minutes, and I hung up. In my estimation, you are totally wasting your time, money, and sanity when dealing with this stupid company.\\nIf I could give it zero stars, I would.\\nBig discount, saved money!\\nENJOYED TAKING THIS COUSRE. VERY DETAILED AND SIMPLE TO TAKE! RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!\\nI have used the door guards for years in various apartments I have lived in.  The door guard helps to keep out unwanted noise and cigarette smoke from inconsiderate people who smoke in common areas of the apartments.  I prefer the solid colors of green or blue, but the tapestry print is nice.  I highly recommend the door guards.\\nGreat stickers, really original and good looking.\\nGreat selection, prices, and reasonable shipping rates. I couldn\\'t really ask for anything more.\\nHelpful, friendly and didn\\'t give me any problems . Got my refund very quickly\\nI feel very safe in ordering on line and the service is very good.

I have high hopes that it will work well!\\nWhere\\'s the Easy Button?\\nI bought a new textbook thinking it had all the material, as it said in the description, but upon review it didnt have the access code. \\r\\nWhen contacting customer service they were very rude. They did not want to give me a return shipping label. The lady kept talking back to me. I will never order anything from Bookbyte again. \\r\\nGoing with [external reference] all the way.\\nI first switched to Eagle Optics over a dozen years ago when I branched out from Bird watching to Butterflies and Dragonflies, which required a much closer focus. I started light with a 7 x 35 which they don\\'t make anymore and once convinced of the quality I bumped myself up to Ranger 10 x 50 which I have carried ever since. In terms of bang for the bucks I don\\'t think you can do any better, I use my binoculars pretty roughly. I don\\'t do this on purpose I\\'m just not the kind of person who is going to use a case and eye cups etc. They need to live mostly on my pick up seat with whatever else is there. My original 10 X 50\\'s are in for the third time for a free cleaning and minor repair. I talked with a rep explaining my needs and decided to order a new pair of 10 X 50\\'s and use the old pair as a back up or to lend a visitor.  Hopefully I will get to see my 600th life bird for the lower 48 with my new pair once they arrive  as I am just 8 birds away.  Birds, butterflies, Odes I don\\'t think you can go wrong with Eagle Optics. F,M, Stiteler\\nFirst time ordering  and experienced  the worst customer service. They give you one price over the phone and charge  a different  price online. Also, didn\\'t  get all the parts I have ordered  as a kit and they tried to sell separately when I called them after receiving  a partial shipment. Would have been so much better and faster  to go to the local part store. Learned a  lesson after been through  all these hassles.\\nthe room was clean, its in the zone 1 of Paris,which is really good for city explorers. the people are kind and speak english. nice stay for some days in Paris. \\nits a little bit noisy by night, you can hear the people next to you speaking, but for few days its a nice location.\\nFits like shown & great material\\nBest products ever!\\nWhen I was down & out & had no where to turn to as I tried other agencies, I saw an advertisement about ClearOne....I was hesitant to call & figured I would be turned down, but I wasn\\'t......A wonderful man named Joe L. helped me get my life on track financially.......I was so relieved.......I would recommend ClearOne to anyone who needs financial help.....It saved me............Diane\\nVery nice service\\nThe fastest shipping I\\'ve ever had from an online supplement store. The layout is also very easy to navigate. I WILL buy more from this shop and recommend it to anyone.\\nMy room was 231.  Right after my Mom & I got settled in, I climbed in the bed closest to the window.  I immediately hear a cell phone vibrating to the left of me. Both of our phones were on the night stand between us, so I started looking for this phone I thought may have been left by a previous person. Looked under the curtains, edge of the bed and between the mattress....nothing.  A bit later, Mom says, \"No, I\\'m fine.\" I ask her what she is talking about. She says, \"You asked me if I was warm enough.\"  Oh no I didn\\'t! I hadn\\'t said anything at all.  During the night (about 3 am) I wake up to see a dark shadow at the end of my Mom\\'s bed. It disappeared quickly. Then to top if off, later I wake up to pressure on my bed, like someone had sat on it!! This happened about 4 times!  I\\'ve never experienced that type of thing before, so I was a bit unnerved by it!  I\\'m wondering if the remodeling a few doors down stirred something up?\\ngreat online passport service. fast turn about and hassle free. it\\'s really great service.\\nCame right on time. Perfect.

Thank you, LaserAway!\\ncould not change the pick up time.\\nThis website has a very helpful staff if you run into any issues.\\nOne of the worst shipping companies out there.  I have a package autoshipped every 10 days.  At first the package arrived in 3 days.  Now it takes at least 2 weeks.  I follow the tracking and it stops in my state then goes to Georgia then Florida before it comes back to North Carolina.  I would NEVER ship anything with them.  Unfortunately most of the companies I work with use them.

My item arrived very quickly, with no issues or damage. The bracket fit my truck perfectly, the only downside was that it didn\\'t come with mounting hardware (which I should have checked for before ordering). It was easy to mount on my front bumper in the spot designed into the truck for it. Overall, this was a quick, painless transaction that I am very happy with.\\nHidden charges. Insurace?!

Nor was it explained until the very end where my credit card information was already given and I had no choice but to accept the fee. The explanation for the fee sounded bogus to me.  Then I was switched over to the internet part of the process only to be told that I would be charged $34.99 instead of the $19.99 advertised.  And I had no choice at all then, because I would be charge the Dish cancellation fee if I changed my mind.  Honest advertising seems to something Dish needs to work on.

Because there were 4 adults & 1 infant my criteria were an estate car, at the best price from a company with an on-airport office, this limited my choice of deals. I had to pay for a full tank of fuel, but I used nearly all of it. I also heard that many companies were now finding minor faults on return and charging inflated repair prices, so I paid the 6E a day full insurance - expensive, but meant no-worries. I was directed to INTERRENT (which is part of Europcar). They were quick, but did not have the model of the estate that I had booked available, so without any fuss or extra-charge gave us a big diesel VW, which was a really good car.

The dogs are insured for any illness or injury that might occur while they are being cared for by a Rover sitter. Our experience with the sitter was excellent too.  If you can use the internet, you can use Rover.com.\\nMy daughter, who is 14, wanted to get the special deal on leggings, 2 for $24, she only got one, and when she tried to email, they stated, \"We don\\'t respond to emails.\" Then we got a $49.95 membership fee! SCAM!!! She is under age, not old enough to join any membership that costs money! She just wanted to order some nice leggings. If we have any further issues, we will be reporting to the authorities since this practice is illegal.\\nI love the sea turtle design of my window sticker, but am not happy because you can\\'t see it from a distance, only if you are looking on top of it; I ended up removing it because of that.

When I received the email about my delivery I was scheduled between  6 & 9 pm. I was surprised since I had scheduled so far out. On delivery day I hadn’t heard anything from them. I called the store at 8:50 pm and they said it would be 10:10 pm before they would be coming. I told them that would be to late. The next morning I called and it was going to be another week before they could get me back in the schedule. After talking to the manager  he said there was nothing he could do because I declined the delivery. I told them that was to late to be delivering on a week night. I don’t want to do business with anyone not concerned with my time. I went and got my money back and went somewhere else. I had my washer delivered at a normal hour.\\ntook few min to solve a problem and the approach was wonderful.\\nIt\\'s always a pleasure to order from Queesboro.

The selection on this site was amazing. Great prices and very well designed website. It made my task easy!\\nI\\'ve never rented a storage unit before. This year I have experienced 2 different types.  My friend rented one at the same time I did at another location from a different company.   I have learned much.   I feel secure here.  I have nothing of real value, but I needed space and I didn\\'t want an outdoor unit.   Bugs or mice NOT destroying my belongings seemed like a priority for me.  I have many items in large containers but some things are too large to protect completely.  \\r\\nMy friend has an outdoor drive up unit, she speaks of the chance of mice getting in.  We packed hers for an upcoming move.  She has a lot of important items in the unit.  I felt uneasy, she was matter of fact about it.  I never would have believed how nice Lifestorage was if I had not been there Myself.  It is above my expectations.  I have had family come along to help me with large items and everyone has been impressed.  This Harwood Heights location has been a gift to me.  I am glad I found it.  Other wise Id be in a crammed house trying to cope during transition.\\nOrder was on time, well packaged, and best of all, the price was just right, including shipping to the Caribbean (via third party courier service).

Then they wanted me to pay to ship it back to them and refused to send the part I ordered. I contacted them more than 10 times and they always pass the buck to another department or manager but will bot give anyone\\'s name to contact. Lots of computer generated replies and run-around.

I\\'m very pleased to be a loyal customer of theirs.\\nI called several times about my order and got the same person every time! She said she was having trouble with her computer and could not help me. I paid thirty extra dollars to have my order shipped faster. What a joke! It still took several days to get the package.

I ordered Sugar Bells and while some were juicy and sweet, I was disappointed to find that over half of them were dry and unappetizing. Was there a drought or had they been in storage?  This shipment was an unpleasant surprise.\\nI had made a few orders in the past with no problems.  In the past I did not need anything shipped urgently, so I would use 2-3 day shipping.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis last order that I made was a rush order so I paid the overnight delivery fee to get my products on time.  However,  It took them an extra day to ship the items.   They said that it was because I entered a PO Box on accident instead of my home and that it was an issue with Paypal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIts not my fault that there is a paypal issue.  I relied on LED supply to be efficient and get the products out on time.  Overnight shipping almost doubled my order cost.  I was late on getting my product done and had a very disapointed client.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLED supply says it still not their fault and offered no compromise and stopped replying to me.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI will find another LED supplier to order from next time\\nWhat else can I add outstanding as I have many times before.\\nI have used Bake Me a Wish numerous times over the years to send a special birthday treat to my family members.

When we returned from our trip, I called that number and got a recording to the effect that it was not a working number.  I then had to dig for a different number to call you to request getting picked up from the airport.

The garage location is phenomenal and convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that said:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. I\\'ve walked to the garage one 4 occasions when flying into Seattle after 7PM because the shuttle takes too long (15+ minutes).\\r\\n2. I prefer scanning my membership card to leave; for the last 2 months the machine has been charging me $3,491 dollars. Each time the attendant has needed to take my payment rather than me using the machine. My question is why the machine is still malfunctioning after 2 months when employees know of the problem?\\r\\n3. From time to time I\\'ve had to park in valet because the entire garage is full; driving to a separate, off-site, WallyPark is inconvenient once I\\'m at the Garage. I should not be given an attitude when asking for my normal pricing under those circumstances, but I am. Each time I\\'ve had to use free parking points to decrease my valet bill when the only reason I used valet was because the entire garage was full (including the roof where the card reader is inoperable). I\\'ve tried other garages, and if WallyPark employees can\\'t see past company policies in order to accommodate paying customers, then I will continue going elsewhere. \\r\\n4. I still haven\\'t heard a return phone call from the Garage General Manager after leaving a message over a year ago.\\r\\n4. Finally, only a small minority of the employees I\\'ve come across have been even close to friendly. I don\\'t have to use WallyPark; I would rather park in an uncovered lot further away and pay friendly, accommodating people than park at your nicer garage and deal with non-chalant attitudes and very poor customer service skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, I park in your garage roughly 40 weeks per year, 3 or 4 nights per week.\\nVeterans United was the ultimate loan team. They made every step effortless and our personal loan officer was fantastic. I have never had a loan go this smooth.

They stated I could not pay over the phone.  I would have to go in and pay.  They did not act like they cared if I ordered the part.  I went online and found this part.  All I did was put in the make and model and they pulled up the part.  I was afraid it would not be right but it came in with a black cover.  A friend of mine put it on in 5 minutes.  I saved  $164.00 and did not have to get off work to order.  I would recommend to try this site before you pay big bucks to dealership\\nThe ApriSweet Bars are the best!  This is my second order.\\nFeel like being cheated\\n\\nI started with Rebtel last month on a trial period and signed up for their $10/month for unlimited calls to India. Just now I tried calling a friend and there was an automated message that youve reached the max limit of unique numbers you could call. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I bought this thing so that I could make non commerical calls to family and friends back in India. Why would you restrict this to a few numbers. Whatever dumb person in your company has made this decision let them know that Indians have wider social group and we are a community oriented group. If you dont fix my account to take this restriction off NOW, I am straight away disconnecting mine and three other similar connections.

I highly reccomend BECHARMING and if I\\'m ever at the MOA, I plan to visit in person.  Wishing you all a beautiful and blessed Holiday Season!\\nI signed us up on 3 other house and pet sitting sites before I joined Trusted Housesitters, because they cost less for membership. When I finally signed up for a 3-month membership on TH, I found how superior this site is:  more listings, more information, emails with new possibilities right to my inbox, and the chance to have people leave reviews about us.

Thank you!\\nI like their new ability to save designs so we don\\'t have to re-design online every time we order.  I still don\\'t like the fact that we have to pay for a new print plate every time we order wristbands with the same design we printed on the last order.\\nTheir website is easy to use and the items I ordered arrived in a very short time and were well packaged.\\nA year into our house sitting adventure around the UK and trusted house sitters is still our go to site. We signed up for a few house sitting websites and still find we are getting the most of our sits through the site. The community is great and they offer very good support. The worldwide reach is probably the best I have experienced across the sites we use regularly.  Sometimes searching for sits between specific dates doesn\\'t work as expected which results in a lot of listing browsing, this lightning it be a problem for some, but if your full time house sitting it sometimes can be frustrating when searching for a specific window in the future. Cost wise there are cheaper sites, but it\\'s still a very small amount of money to pay considering the value you save from just one night housesitting vs paying for a hotel. Overall I recommend trusted house sitters.\\nexcellent product, took awhile to receive, like an extra 2 weeks longer than expected\\nThe oranges from Hale Grove are the freshest tasting, sweetest and juiciest citrus I’ve ever enjoyed. My introduction to this grove was at Christmas with a selection of mixed varieties. I also sent this gift box to three friends as gifts and they were thrilled.

They tell you one thing on the phone. When you get the loan the down payment isn\\'the what they tell you on the phone.\\nBooked through Trivago.  Trivago site took me to Hoteling.  \\r\\nPut in dates.  Confirmation email had wrong dates.  \"Manage my Booking\" had no option to correct.  \"Chat\" never connected after two twenty minute tries.  Trivago\\'s 212 Customer Service number messaging said it could not accept anymore calls.  Finally went on back on line and found Hoteling site to cancel.  Charged me a $14.00 fee to cancel DUE TO THEIR BOOKING ERROR AND NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Never did speak to a live person.

And everything was easy\\nOrdered the part on the weekend and I had the part by Wednesday with standard shipping.\\nno problems..all went smoothly\\nWe have booked 2 reservations through VRBO with no problems.\\nYumi has been amazing every time she\\'s helped me!\\nVery satisfied with headlight assembly, great value\\nExtremely helpful!!\\nHad problems with my order so I called costumer service. Talked with them and problem was solved quickly. Very good costumer service! Thank you!!\\nThanks- we switched from chewy.com to you because they stopped supplying the food we fed our dogs.  I think the transition was seamless and you are just as good to work with as they were.\\nNo nonsense company. The promotion offered was exactly what was delivered. No add ons, no extras, no problems. The food is great as well! Will gladly do business with Wise Foods again.\\nParts were reasonable price and one part missed component due to packing in warehouse. It came with missing component, but they credited the amount as it was very cheap under $10. Overall. I think it looks great and hope to review other part performance when mechanic places it. One thing I must want is the longer warranty on struts and shocks than a year, but that might be standard warranty time at other places too.\\nservices I had from this site always met my expectation.\\nYou want my honest opinion but your staff are not.   I’m done beating a dead horse.  All I can do is tell myself lesson learned and never again.  So sad that to be my age and be so disrespected by your staff.  I trusted them and wow was I scammed.\\ni love this site it give me something to do and earn free money.\\nI love thrift books! Every book I buy is always in great condition! I highly recommend!\\nShipping and pricing are excellent. Customer service by phone for me was poor.\\nMy plants arrived a bit dry this time, and more disturbing, the soil was gone from around the roots on some plants where the corrugated board was not covering the top. Five of six plants look pretty good, the one with the least soil around the roots looks iffy. It must have been a hastily done job. This is out of the ordinary for Bluestone. Usually the plants are adequately moist and the corrugated container is snug around the top of the pot.\\nCustomer Service is top notch!! They are professional, knowledgeable and courteous. Great people to work with!!\\nI enjoy receiving my monthly case of wine. So far I have been happy with the variety and the price. Mostly Californian wines, I wish there was more European and S. American but it is a different \"club\"\\nGreat books. Quality pretty good. Fast shipment!. It became my favorite one for used books.\\nI found the prices to be excellent, and when I followed through with the confirmation number, all was set.  My only issue was the tickets went down in price significantly within 2 days, but that is not their fault!   Economy shifts!  Dang!  I should have bided my time a little longer!\\nHi Everyone,\\r\\nI need a car part,  a very expensive that a local car pats place quoted $400  that I was able to get through PartsGeek  for a little more than $100.00\\r\\nWhen I ordered,  I asked for expedited shipping and was told that it could only ship 5 day ground.  \\r\\nI ordered the part on Wednesday and on Friday,  it was at my house.\\r\\nI am very pleased with PartsGeek service and would encourage others to use it.\\nI always get great  products at great prices. Always prompt on shipment.\\nodering was simple and delivery was fast.\\nThriftbooks is a great resource for any book in or out of print. The notification function is ideal, with email notification the minute your requested  book is located ; I have found many titles this way. That said, the quality is uneven. Each selection has the graded condition listed for your selection prior to purchase. This is very accurate on the Good and below levels, but for the higher ratings I find it a gamble. Books listed as like new which come from independent sellers are generally as advertised.  Books listed as like new that come directly from Thriftbooks warehouse are generally beat up. If you don\\'t care about appearances, them it\\'s no worry. But I have been burned many times purchasing a book that I intended to gift, only to receive it and realize the \"like new\" book was often scratched and bent and in no condition to give as a gift.\\nVery nice hotel . It was very clean and with great staff ready to help with any concerns if we had one.\\nThe blues were blue the greens were green the stuff showed up on my front porch screen.\\nI have bought several gift cards! Most of time I bought e-gift card for online shopping. \\r\\ne-gift card is more convenient and shipped immediately!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne time the macy\\'s gift card was locked and called macy\\'s to unlock.\\nRebates takes to long to receive. I have made a purchase 8 weeks ago and the payout still say pending.\\nlove this place shippings expensive.. but it equals out in the long run to be cheaper then other places. love it!!!\\nSuch an easy experience! found a great trip at a great price!\\nToo good to explain\\nI was relatively clueless, buying my first home was a major process. Months of searching for a house that needed handicap accessibility or little renovation was made easier with the realtor that understood my needs. When it came to all the documentation, the portal made providing documentation and electronic signatures so easy and saved time. Phone calls and emails were almost always responded to with in a couple hours if not immediately.\\nAbsolutely wonderful. They always answered my questions and we never had any issues. All the hotel employees when checking in said how great the company was too which made me trust it. I have recommended it to 6 people.\\nShipping was crazy expensive. This needs to be corrected. I paid a 1/4 more in shipping costs. I was prepared to pick the item up at the store. This is very deceptive and frustrating. I would suggest you figure out another alternative. I could have drove to Chicago and picked it up myself and drove back for cheaper than what you charge. How about give people the option to pickup at the store for no charge. Dont plan on going back and still on the fence about cancelling my order. \\nPro: Sales person was nice and helped me get what I needed though.\\nEasy to buy and great price, could use paypal though\\nI found your website through my daughter\\'s swim team. I am so happy with my experience. Your site was easy to work with, your customer service people answered all of my questions. The plaque we ordered shipped out quickly. My account director was happy with the final result. We will use you again!\\nVery easy. Lots of details. Found the perfect HOME away.\\nI have been using NFM for over 20 years and I am proud today to continue utilizing your services..\\nwould definetely recommend to others! VERY satisfied!\\nyesterday, I put in $20.00 , but, when I tried to make a call, it said that I have 6 cents left ( the balance on my receipt is stating $20.54 ) I have sent 3 e-mails to support so far and the issue is still not resolved.\\nEdwin did a very good job in guiding me through the process.  He did everything he said he would do in a very timely manner.  He was just the person I hoped I would find to help with my international ticket purchases.  He is the kind of employee that makes any company great.  I will use ASAP Tickets again for my next trip.\\nExcellent al the way.\\nFirst time order at Vapeworld.  I would use it again..\\nIve been using this company for about a year. I havent had any problems with them until this month. I contacted the owner via facebook messenger and he mailed me my payment within hours. His name is Jonathon and he informed me that they have been having some issues and apologized to me. If you are having problems go to him directly.\\nPureFormulas has the best quality around and the prices are reasonable.\\nThe website is easy to maneuver and I was able to use my phone to verify reservations.\\nI would have to say that based on the service provided this is the best bang for your buck. I was trying to purchase another unit from public storage only to find out that it was $20 more after hidden fees. Self storage is the way to go!\\nThe email I received reminded me of my reservations made everything so easy and simple thank you\\nDoorbell cam stopped recording within a year and front door key lock battery dies within days but don\\'t use it...\\nI love my new compression gloves. They lessen the arthritis pain.\\nTerrible customer service!!!!!!  If you have a problem with your booking, the customer service phone numbers do not reach a person.  They route you back to the website, which ONLY OFFERS you the ability to send an EMAIL to the company.  So in reality, there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.\\nVery good experience\\nWell just finished my Adobe Webmaster course with e-Careers and I must say I was very impressed. Great customer services and loads of online tutorials with easy to use project files so that you can work while watching the videos. I\\'m definitely going to be signing up to another course ASAP 10/10 top marks.\\nI continue to get the stuff I need to stay in shape from SWh. Thanks guys!\\nNatisha was a great help and also very kind!\\nEasy navigation and great communication,\\nAs a special educator in Texas I find myself at odds with the school system for many reasons. The fact that my daughter has dyslexia and ADHD does not help this fact, nor does the fact I work with students who have special needs. Because of this, after my daughter had been in two different schools, and with my experience in several schools and districts, I knew I had to make homeschool work for her.  I enrolled my daughter in January 2017 in Enlightium, with the hope that she would have fewer stressors from school work, so she wouldn\\'t shut down or flat out refuse to do her work.\\n\\n Her first semester was a huge success. The curriculum was challenging for her, but not too, difficult. She was able to receive the one-on-one attention from me or a family friend who worked with her. She was also able to have the work chunked into manageable parts, so she could complete it in a timely manner and spend less time on school work. Also, since the work was online there were no more worries about whether or not it would get turned in to the teacher. I\\'m not saying any of this went off without a hitch, but it was much better than her spending 8 hours a day in an environment that overwhelmed her and caused a significant amount of anxiety to perform without the assistance she needed.\\n\\n Another bonus for both of us is the way Christianity and Biblical teachings are integrated into all subjects. It is done so in a matter-of-fact way, and points out that others may have different beliefs. The Bible is also used to back up all of the teachings and effects of believing or not believing in a loving  God.   \\n\\nI cannot say how grateful I am that Enlightium Academy is available. If you are a parent who wants you child to succeed and excel then I believe Enlightium will work for you and your child if you are willing to work together. I can\\'t wait to see what this year brings for my daughter,  how she has grown and will grow.\\nI bought a Garmin 45 dash cam, they charged me on my credit card, but I never received the camera, instead they returned it to themselves, they reversed the credit card transaction, and never gave an explanation of what they did or why they did it. The one thing I know is that I lost a $15 coupon that I used for the purchase, because they didn\\'t return that.\\nIt can often be difficult to place a gift order from overseas. No problems here, and great selection of quality gift baskets.\\nI’m happy that I am on my way to a life free of debt.\\nI loved my item! It came very quickly and it was as advertised! I\\'ll be referring this site to as many people as possible and I\\'ll be purchasing more!❤️\\nWe love puzzles and do 20-30 during the winter months (when there is no baseball).  We love all types, but not all brands.  No one comes close to the quality puzzles that White Mountain Puzzles provides.  5 stars!\\nGreat service fast shipping !!!\\nHave not had a chance to try the unit yet but soon to get it into the system I will follow up soon\\nI have used them before and they have prompt service\\nI chose Veterans United for a no money down VA Loan and they did a fantastic job from start to finish.  My loan officer, Daniel Heggarty, walked us through the process from pre-qualification, approval to closing.  They helped me find an agent and made sure the process was kept moving along.  When we started having delays with the listing agent, he got on it with both the listing and our agent to get things done.  We even got a check back from VU for using the agent they recommended and we got money back at closing too.  I really couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.  We love our new house!\\nWhat a great site to book flights!  Quick, easy and Customer Service is very helpful!!  I am going to book all my flights with JustFly from now on!!\\nInflates the prices on their poor quality shirts and then puts out a promotion of reduced price. Lately their 10-15$ shirts are 25$ with 50% off.\\nShirt prints crack and peel quickly.\\nI had spent at least ten years researching and checking out gutter protection services for our home. After numerous \"Home Shows\" and In-Home demonstrations, I selected a winner. Fortunately, my painstaking research and patience has paid off well. The Leaf Filter gutter protection system has performed exceptionally well. It has handled the Midwest winters over the past couple of years and continues to perform as promised. When I have gone up on the roof, which has been much less since installation of the system, I do check out the system and it still looks as good as it did on the day it was installed. I have recommended the system to numerous individuals and will continue to do so.\\nI do a lot of Internet surfing and pick up lots of computer problems having Regcure I am very confident that my computer is safe.\\nTrustedHousesitters.com has been our go-to housesitting website.  The user interface is very welcoming and easy to use and is beginning to get momentum with clientele.\\nmy experience with Veterans United, from my initial discussion with\\r\\nDaniel Lowes, senior loan officer, to the visit to my home from the \\r\\nnotary to notarize the final documents went as smooth as I could ask for.\\r\\nI would recommend Veterans United to anyone!\\nThis is a fine site, but the job notification emails are not closely targeted enough.\\nI  never saw the flowers I sent but the recipients were more than pleased.  Only snafu was I couldn\\'t use the discount they gave me with my first purchase, but when I emailed they corrected it right away.  Beautiful flowers, great customer service.  I really like that Bouqs works with the farmers and growers directly.\\nAll the black rapid straps and parts are all great and work well.\\r\\nCarried d7100 and 24-70 lens on three mile hike to water fall on very steep trail with no problems and no neck pain from strap\\nLarge selection good prices.\\nAdt communication & service was beyond my expectations!\\nI bought a player from Bombay and was satisfied with the level of their service.  I had a couple of product related questions prior to purchase and received quick and clear responses by e-mail.\\nthe item was great. the shipping time was fast and i would order again and tell others to look into being a customer\\nI got a replacement tail light for  my F-150.  The price was so far below what a Ford replacement would cost that I was concerned that the item would be of substandard quality, but I couldn\\'t tell the difference between the two.  The shipping was expedient and reasonable.\\nMy wife and I travel from Australia to Sweden at least once a year and having previously had Alpha Flight Guru organise First Class flights for us at great savings, we did not hesitate to contact them again for departure in May this year.  We were given careful attention by Cris Acosta and yesterday he finalised return Business Class tickets for us from Sydney to Sweden via Copenhagen, at a massive saving.  Thank you Cris for your personal and most professional services.  Roger and Yvonne Gersbach.\\nGreat. On time as requested.\\nI love not going to the store every few days to pick up food for three cats. I have a very busy schedule so it\\'s a great time saver.\\r\\n Also you were the only service that had a variety of wellness cat food(my cats only eat sliced or chunky chicken,not the traditional pate) I could not find it at any delivery service. The price is very reasonable,cheaper then the stores and I received my order within a couple of days.  -Thanks\\nI am really satisfied with the CA Realty classess.\\nSkinstore used to be my go-to for products with its great deals and customer service. They were taken over by another company based in the UK in recent years, and since then, the customer service/communication has been appalling. \\n\\nLast year, I ordered a product that took about a month to arrive with no communication about the delay from Skinstore. When the product finally arrived, it wasn\\'t the one I ordered, nor was there was anything written on the box to indicate that it was from Skinstore. There was no invoice or anything written inside that said Skinstore. Just a random product. I was scared to open it in fact, and when I tried to communicate with Skinstore, I received automated messages in return. No one picked up the customer service phoneline even though it was well within the listed hours. I didn\\'t understand why I was trying so hard to reach them when I wasn\\'t even sure this random product was from Skinstore. It took another few weeks to resolve this issue because the web interface wouldn\\'t allow for attached images. To skip ahead in this process, I was offered $5 off or something ridiculous for a 2 month drawn out process.\\n\\nNever again will I order from this company.\\nexcellent service!\\nHorrible customer service, lost a room due to hurricane season last year and the company refuses to give any information when asked how to get a hold of the owner so that we may refund the 400.00 we are out. Apparently since the owner no longer does business with them they can\\'t do anything or attempt to even help. Was even told that 400.00 isn\\'t a lot of  money. This company is terrible don\\'t use them!\\nNeeded an emergency dentist and they couldn’t find me one. He never called me. So I don’t know if it’s 800 dentist or the dentist.\\nI was dismayed when I tried to call PartsGeek to find out why my order had been cancelled. I called three times with the same results, automatically put on hold forever.\\r\\nI went online to look the part up. Originally the website showed two parts available for shipping. I ordered and then a few days later got an email sending me credit with no explanation. I went back to the website and saw that there was now only one part but still available. My guess is that there are NO parts available and the system is flawed by not keeping proper track of their inventory. I found the same part at a rival web store for a mere $3 more and within literally days I had it in my hands.\\r\\nI know things get screwed up. That said someone answering a phone or a real-time online person would have kept me shopping at the website.\\r\\nThat was my last-stop shopping at PartsGeek.\\nThe auto we got  from AutoEurope was through Hertz from 5/3-5/14 dropping the car in Paris.  We paid the topline insurance and paid Hertz for the different drop-off location when we picked up the car in LeHavre, Fr. on 5/3.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5/5, we received word that our son was in the Intensive Care Unit for an anticipated liver transplant in NY.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe immediately made arrangements to fly home the next morning from Milan which was the closest airport.  I checked with AutoEurope to confirm that there was a Hertz office so we could drop the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drove to Milan at 5:30 am.  We were charged an additional $470 that we had to pay Hertz at the drop-off.  We had no choice - we had to get back to NY.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe only had the car for 3 days, paid the top insurance coverage, and the different drop-off fee.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIs there any way to get some compensation for using the car only 3 days out of the 11 paid for?\\nNothing works the way it used to in the past, latest version terrible, web version doesn\\'t refresh automatically, desktop version always with problems to login. Looking for some alternative out there in the market, because I really can\\'t rely on skype anymore.\\nbought gift card for $50 but there was no value on it\\nSo convenient!  Same price I would pay at the local store, but instead, it arrives at my front door with free shipping!!\\nThese people take your money for 11 months then claim to not have an attorney in your area to represent you, then takes 45 BUSINESS DAYS to issue a refund on your money so in essence keeping and using your money to fund their business practices for free for 12 months!! Run for the Dan hills these liars, cheats are crooked stupid people. Again RUN DON\\'T WALK AWAY FROM THESE THIEVES!!!\\nWebsite fails frequently when traffic is high, blocking you to buy/sell.

Never even lag 100 days! It is a problem, perhaps more trouble than my country than the HD. Another case my products arrived incomplete and I\\'ve never won more!

It\\'s right on the money. I got it fairly quickly and customer support was excellent when I contacted them before the order. I\\'m going to use it with my necklace :)\\nEXCELLENT! My only complaint would be that I never got any confirmation emails for anything bit it did come very quickly.\\nOver the past 6 mo - 1 year, I noticed that the quality of clothing is not what it used to be. I really like the clothing line displayed and the discounts are great, but when I\\'ve received items that I\\'ve worn once (torn), ordered pants (very cheap metal zipper - the kind that rust after 1st wash), cotton count (where you can see through the skirt), etc. I still shop at Tobi as you can find some unique items but only when on major discount or sale.\\nI finally gave up trying to use amazon prime with 1000bulbs  as I could not find the items I needed so I ordered direct from 1000bulbs and am not too happy with the high shipping charge.\\nThe pictures provided enough information along with the other reviews and seeing the replies to help decide to contact to rent the property\\nThis place is a joke.  And the customer service is horrendous.  They had advertised guaranteed delivery by mother\\'s day if ordered by May 2.  Placed order before cutoff.  Today is the 12,  mother\\'s day has passed and when I check on my order status they still have not even shipped!  I had to email customer service 3 times before I finally got a response.  And the reply was not satisfactory!  First they said I did not order by cutoff date...I ordered by cutoff and have email confirmation to prove.  Then they said in order to receive guaranteed  delivery you had to choose urgent delivery!   Really?  Because it did not say that in your advertisement for guaranteed delivery and when I was checking out I saw no urgent delivery option.  Long story short my wife still has no mother\\'s day present!  Do not buy from them!  Take you money and business elsewhere.\\nI always shopped around for textbooks in college and Bigwords always did what I needed and probably more.\\nExcellent products at great prices\\nEasy checkout, detailed item information.\\nI\\'ve always had good service when ordering from Wise.

I can get my scores for free.  I know my score and I know why it is where it is.  I am working on it, but in the mean time I need a vehicle.  I need a loan, not someone to explain my credit to me and charge me an auto pay of almost $40.00 month for it.\\nI\\'ve always had a very easy time dealing with Doheny\\'s and use them at the start and close of our pool season for the last 4 years without question.  This was an anomoly - the first time that we had any issue.  Apparently there was an issue with my credit card on this particular order - we\\'re all human and it happens.  My issue is that Doheny\\'s made no effort to contact me to inform that there was a problem.  Instead, the order just sat \"in process\" until I called 5 days later to find out why I hadn\\'t received it yet.  That\\'s when I was informed that there was a problem with the payment.  I gave them the number again by phone and it went thru immediately, but the fact remains that if I hadn\\'t called, it would still be sitting and waiting.  Just have to believe that there is some step in their order process where they could/would note orders that were submitted but had some sort of issue and that they would then reach out to the buyer to get the order finished and shipped out...\\nGreat  price on 4 Hydro Flask water bottles. Free delivery in two days. I will be ordering from them again -- soon!!\\nI received my card quickly. I have not use it yet, but I am excited about using it soon.\\nI annually send the grapefruit mixture to my Florida born and raised daughter now living in NC.

Definitely will return.\\nExcellent course, learn a lot from it. The best part that we can do it in your own pace. Thank you.\\nStamford Plaza Hotel reception and management treated us very well.  Accommodation was fine but service in restaurant was lacking in our experience, but would have no hesitation in recommending hotel on balance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBooking though GalaHotels.com was very dissappointing.  The booking was confirmed to me immediately but not to the hotel who were not expecting our arrival.  They treated us very courteously, providing a room, albeit not at the previously booked rate, whilst they tried to sort the situation out with Gala.  My emails to GalaHotels.com were unanswered and the telephone numbers unavailable although payment to the hotel was made by the time we were ready to check out with no additional cost to us.  The effect of all this took up unnecessary time and made it impossible for us to fulfill our first event planned for Sydney.  An altogether very unsatisfactory booking through GalaHotels.com.\\nWalked in needed tires ASAP , they worked in for me.👍\\nShipping went well, fast and at no more cost to me.\\nGarrett was really helpful. He answered all of my questions and responded to my emails in a timely fashion.\\nI absolutely love Delivery.com. It\\'s a no-brainer delivery site that offers amazing discounts. I highly recommend them!\\nThe application was easy and I was approved quickly.\\nThe service was quick and accurate. The representative was very courteous.\\nThe books I ordered were sent quickly and landed at my doorstep in no time at all. However, the books were slightly more used than previous experiences and other retailers I have used in the past. I will use TextbookRush again but would like to see less highlighting and writing in the books in the future!\\nI would recommend this company\\nProducts are nice and prices are good. Shipping is a bit expensive but I\\'m sure that has a lot to do with the size of packages.\\nI did not update my resume.  The same one is out there that has been for a while.  I did look at a job that was sent to me via email and applied to see if I could get more info.  The last time I did update my resume with my credentials an email was sent to my employer who found me thru Career Builder.  Not happy about this at all.\\nExcellent price match and search. Awful experience when trying to book - had an error of \"name is too long to complete booking, please call our phone number to complete booking\"\\nWhen I tried calling there was a busy signal for two hrs. Finally shortened our names in hopes it won\\'t be a problem later.\\nGot my iPhone watch at good price and excellent condition. Thank you.\\nWe just settled my first credit card dead. The customer service department did a great job thank you\\nNothing to say. Just Happy\\nI am almost always pleased with what I receive, and when on rare occasions I am not, Miles Kimball makes it good.\\nI spent over an hour walking around NYC trying to find where to board the bus...even after getting direction 3Xs from people who should know the area (policemen in patrol car, garbage man, an commercial vehicle parking garage). The street address in the email sent out is not quiet accruate either. I had to call you, Go Bus, and speak to a customer service rep, who help find the bus. The bus pass me as I had gotten close which also help me to find it but once do I got there, the bus driver was very abrupt and rude. I walk up to the bus as the driver was coming off the bus and before I could ask him anything, he just walk off the bus and past me saying (with poor english), \"too soon bus.\" I turned to asked him another question, saying excuse me, sir...sir...excuse! He kept walking and ignored me. I repeated myself saying the same words a little louder in case he did not me but he kept on walking. It was first time riding the bus. Not the best experience if you hold any importance to word of mouth...for obvious reasons. The ride itself and the fact I got to my finally destination early after a horrible experience because of the bad Nor\\'easter storm that hit the area in the form of heavy rain and wind left me stranded in NYC at the airport with no place to stay and an exceptionally large smount of money for a Urber to a noisy little sleepless night at an Airbnb. The the bus was my only alternative way home. My seat was not clean either. So yeah...there\\'s allllll of that. Side note: if you consider rethinking the first bus departure schedule for the bus that leave NYC to BOS so it coordinate with first Long Island Long Beach train arriving at Penn station, that would be nice too. I was in a panic trying to get back to Boston for work after all other form of transport was either canceled, sold out or not running to get from point A to B. Thanks\\nI wanted to pay using PayPal but was unable to have it work. Otherwise booking was painless.\\nWonderful quality, great prices, and on-time delivery. What else could you ask for?\\nOrdered the unlock friday night, it was unlock by the end of saturday night. Would recommend to anyone!\\nAfter searching for resume help, I stumbled upon Top Resume and I am very thankful that I did.  Although there was some delay in being matched with a writer, once the process began it was seamless from there.  My resume was transformed into a masterpiece that I felt confident sharing with prospective employers and framed my experience a million times better than I ever could.  I highly recommend that anyone looking for a resume spruce up use TopResume!\\nThe items that I received were of high quality with a fair price. I will definitely use this supplier for future beekeeping needs.\\nSolidly built camera accessories.\\nI would like another size option.  The small one is just a little too small.  The next size up is too large.\\n\\nRay\\nIt didn\\'t work  so I had to pay for a new phone.\\nVery easy to book with no hiccups!\\nso far so good\\nWill definitely tell others about the quick service and product quality.\\nMade my first purchase on supplementwarehouse.com\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir prices are much cheaper than anywhere else i\\'ve looked (Amazon, GNC, Vitamin Shoppe) even with the shipping.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that would make things even better, is if shipping was included in purchases over a certain amount.\\nThe handyman did a good job replacing my toilet, but was very slow with communication. Cost was decent. Customer support was excellent when I contacted them about the guy not getting back to me.\\nI really like and appreciate that surveyjunkie gives a few points even if I don\\'t qualify for a survey. Most survey sites don\\'t do this. These other sites are frustrating as I usually don\\'t qualify for any of their surveys. It is a waste of my time taking these other surveys.\\nItems are reasonably priced, as advertised and received in a very timely manner.\\nExperience was great. Fast service and a quality vehicle for a fair price.\\nWhen I found I couldn\\'t get my sugar-free Emergen-C packets from either of my local health food stores, I started looking online.  PureFormulas\\' prices were best and with the free shipping I chose them.  I was very happy they took PayPal - so no risk.  I received my shipment in a few days along with a free sample of B-12.  Now that I know about PureFormulas, I will definitely shop there again.\\nI never thought doing everything online would go so smoothly. I couldn\\'t imagine going through the process without any face to face meetings. I could not have been more wrong. The process was smooth. I went from start to finish in less than a month. Jeff Koontz from Busey bank deserves all the credit. He is awesome. Look him up and you won\\'t regret it.\\nI absolutely LOVE my dress! The sizes were perfect. The dress delivered very quickly. I cannot wait to slay prom. Thanks so much !\\nLOVE it how it showed me the videos it was fun it\\'s worth it studying with this app, I\\'m so satisfied. It\\'s just perfect.\\nEvery job that I have applied for either doesn\\'t give feed back, but most of them won\\'t hire anyone over 40.\\nGreat service, instant delivery better than using my carrier\\'s methods you have one a lifetime user\\nIt is simple and has fast response.\\nSuper easy to reserve a spot. Courteous and quick shuttle service in both directions. Much easier than parking at the airport and lugging bags to and from long term parking.\\nCustomer service was great, company verified my purchase,which I loved.\\nThe rug is nice. Its not what I thought the fabric would be. Its difficult to tell be a picture.\\nIf you want a trusted tour or day excursion visit viator.com.  Very easy site to navigate.  Great options for every city or country.  Great guides and reasonable pricing for every budget.  Thank you viator for offering these tours for us to enjoy.\\nI was a first time user, needed a book for a graduate class that was on a list to get published. Customer Service was great, paid a little more for the book than I wanted, book came quickly. I was very happy with the service and the condition of the book.\\nHad a great and fast experience with JEDCO. Needed to change my order due to backorder (which you won\\'t know it is until you see your invoice via email) and it went swift and smoothly. Very fast shipping. Thanks\\nThe Hotel is very nice on the architectural side. The beach access and pools are very nice. The night activities shows are very standard, but people make them entertain. \\r\\nWhat really got us mad is the lack of service of the employees on that place. I have been in many 5* Hotels around the world, and this is far away from that. I could rate them 3.5*. I am wondering how did they get that 5* false advertisement. We had man three days there and problem showed up since the first day. All the room smell the humidity very strong. (Never disappear) The AC temperature is like 78 degrees. So if you are expecting 75 or bellow, you are going to sweat or not sleep at night. They can\\'t do anything about it. They re-used the used towels and went short on beach towels. Really? We had to go out and buy some body wash because they where also \"short on supplies\". \\r\\nI will never go there or recommend this hotel to anyone. Part of my family live in Cuba and they saw these situations very common for being in Cuba. The rest of us live in the USA and we were expecting way more. At least Quality Service and fast response.\\nI really  thought I would be doing a lot of shopping with Groupon till I ordered some shirts and one of the shirts sent was wrong color and print type they were all XL ... I’m older in my day I was a large I measured so I got the XL and it was almost to small I’ll never be able to use the dryer with it and I’ll have to package to return more trouble than it’s worth other things I’ve bought is ok like phone chords etc. I don’t know they’ll have to have a heck of a deal for me to buy clothes again. Oh and it was very hard to get to the customer service email page it’s like they’d rather you not find it . I’m sure there good things about Groupon not all my orders were bad ... I think they need to watch out for Amazon tho\\nWe are very happy with our experience at GiftCards.com.  They had the selection we wanted and offered the bonus of personalization.  Delivered on time.  They came through for us.\\nGreat quality and fashionable fitness wear! Working out and looking cute is essential!\\nThis is a fabulous site and works really well, both for those looking for a house sit and also for thosenwanting their pets looked after!  . My mother has just signed up too, as she needed someone to look after her dog while she was away later in the year.  She got an immediate response from some lovely people who are coming down for a holiday and all was organised quickly and efficiently. My first house sit was the same and I loved looking after a cat in London for a wonderful lady.  She was amazing,  sending me directions and recommendations of what to see and do while I was there. Then when I got there I was greeted with beautiful flowers and chocolates and a warm cuddley welcome from the cat.  I didn\\'t want to go home!!  This site has really added so much to my experience of seeing different areas, as for me, the important things about travelling are experiencing the local culture and customs and enjoying what the localities have to offer, rather than seeing all the touristy things. Think I might make housesitting my new career!!\\nI order two times, but then cancel the order.\\r\\nNever order the book from this site\\nThey were excellent to work with. I initially ordered the wrong product on accident.  They fixed my order immediately.  I paid for expedited shipping and the product came faster than called for.  I would do business with them again in the future.\\nMarketplace need some improvement. \\nI wish when I needed to return a book from the marketplace, we could have an more \"official\" channel to do that. Instead I was told to just use my personal E-mail to deal with it.\\nvery user friendly and great prices.  Always first come first serve. Best time to check is after midnight for best pricing.\\nOrdering was easy, delivery was prompt. I was impressed by the quality of the dress, my daughter loves it. Yes, some of the sparkles come off of the top, but not a big deal in my opinion. Would order from SimplyDresses again!!\\nOverall this is a great company, however I do not order from them as frequently because I like to send the vase with the flowers becuase I never want to assume that someone has a vase, and I really hate the vase option. But there is only one vase to choose from. :(\\nVery pleased with our transferring to Aetna Insurance!\\nSo easy, worked great! Thank you, i can now play monster hunter on my switch!\\nWe have several occasions over the last few years of fruit being rotten or just really poor quality.  While they do replace it if you call, I would hope they would start checking it before it goes out.  We hesitate tossed it as a gift anymore because I don\\'t want to put friends and family in the position of having to call and complain about poor quality.  When it is good it is very good, when it is bad it is awful.\\nMy experience has been great!\\nThe Ellie Wilde dress is beautiful on my daughter and very pretty sapphire color.\\nVery good!!! MIKE SPOKE WITH US AND WAS EXCELENT WITH EXPLAINING ALL OUR OPTIONS. THE PRICING WAS DECENT. AND A NO RUSH ATTITUDE WAS SO WELCOMED... WE APPRECIATE YOUR PROMOTION OF THE ONE FREE MONTH WITH BOOKING BY A CERTAIN DATE. YOUR APPROCH TO YOUR SELF STORAGE BUSSINES. HAS GIVEN US THE CONFIDENCE OF A SAFE AND WELL RAN FACILIATY TO LEAVE OUR BEAUTIFUL 5TH WHEEL IN FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS...     THE LENNOXS CANADA\\nLove shopping with Groupon. I\\'ve never had any issues!\\npart ordered and showed up before the date promised  will definitely use again\\nThe girl was very informative and kind. Overall great experience!\\nWhen I called they had me with an agent forover 30 minutes. The gentleman was clueless, kept having to put me on hold. Then he screwed up the transaction and when I called back, i was on hold for 3 minutes and then someone picked up but never answered. You could hear the discussion in background. They are clueless on how to operate a call center. Zero customer focus.\\r\\nRun from Hotwire!\\nThis is my fourth time booking with them. Simple!\\nTHEY KNOW THERE JOB\\nGoMedigap\\'s representative, Jason Heriford and his team are outstanding.  Jason clarified in less than 40 minutes what I needed to know about Medicare and what actions to take... that was amazing!!!  He is well informed and was able to help us make the right decisions based on our needs.  This service is invaluable and I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him and his team.  Thank you all.\\ntook them awhile but they did the right thing and paid via paypal. thanks!\\nThese are the best products that are affordable and as pure as they claim. I would only recommend Nutrabio...bottom line\\nMy husband and i enjoy trying new recipes and foods.  The combinations are great!\\nIt works fine\\nThis was so easy and fun to create labels for a special occasion and gift. Mine were for a gift to give to our wedding party for our wedding coming up in May. We wanted to ask them in a fun, unique way so we created wine labels for the girls and whiskey labels for the guys with a catchy saying asking them to be our bridesmaid or groomsman. The team was VERY helpful if I ever sent any emails with questions they responded FAST! They were made and ship extremely fast as well. I received them before I could believe it! Love this company!\\nTim - Agent # 30980 - EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL!!! Customer Service at it\\'s BEST!!! I thought REAL Customer Service was a \"forgotten past-time\"...then I met Tim!!! This young man should travel the country (companies should hire Tim) to teach true Customer Service to Customer Service Representative...from small businesses to Fortune 100 Companies. If I owned a company, he would be my Vice President!!! I would want Tim - Agent # 30980 to be the face of my company!!!\\nI have been ordering from these people since just about the get-go. I think they were two years old when I found them. I need a northern supplier-other suppliers just don\\'t know our challenges. They have replaced seed that didn\\'t germinate(very likely NOT their fault), dug up some seed for me that was not in the current catalogue, given me advice on phone, answered question patiently, orders come on time, I trust their testing processes. and all in all, I love this company, the staff and comfort of ordering from friends.\\nHad a little gliche on my order but the staff at Dryers RV was very quick to rectify the issue. Over all very satisfied with the service\\nI am especially fond of the Sport Strap, which is great for keeping the strap in place while shooting. I also use the double strap for event work and enjoy the comfort and performance it provides. The price point is right and is a great value for the money. I also like the thoughtful accessories one can use with the straps like the Lockstar, that keeps the ConnectR lock securely in place so there are no accidental detachments of the camera from the straps. I also like the Protectr that has a metal wire that prevents the strap from being cut by a thief, who could otherwise steal one\\'s camera if not alert. Get this accessory for each strap!\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to using BlackRapid straps, I used similar straps from a well known German company in the camera strap world. Both are very good and have their merits and room for improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had a chance to use both brands enough to make a fair comparison from a professional point of view. The BlackRapid straps are lighter and just as comfortable as their German counterparts, which is great for long events wearing two heavy cameras and are more easily managed when transporting them. BlackRapid has a nicer price point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only criticism I have with the BlackRapid system is the connector plate that affixes to the camera. I would prefer a connector plate that rotates in such a fashion that does not allow for it to loosen up under any circumstance. I am the king of over torquing things, but found myself having to re-tighten the connector plate several times, in spite of the design with the carabiner. I realize this may not be a problem for some, but I use 2 Canon 5d Mark IIIs with battery grips and a 70-200mm on one camera with the dual strap ( attach the strap to the lens in this case), so they are heavy as camera rigs go and I don\\'t like the distraction of re-tightening connector plates for fear of a camera becoming detached. That said, BlackRapid is innovative, which I love, so I would love to see this addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, save for my only real concern mentioned above,  the BlackRapid products I own are first-class and are a joy to use. I would recommend their products to anyone looking for a great camera strap or harness.\\nThis was My second time Filing With Them and , I just love how quick and sufficient they are . Highly recommend Them To Any One .\\nBest prices around by far! They always ship in a timely manner. No complaints!\\nMake Booking\\nother than the 100 bucks worth of service fees great\\nThe signs we ordered for our new office are very sturdy as well as attractive.  A nice product at a really good price.\\nOutside of flight delays, trip went very well.\\nI was impressed by your service. I\\'m gonna recommend you to my family and friends. Keep up the good job Justfly\\nvery good customer service, good prices will be back again\\nProduct was as stated and shipping was as expected. What else could you hope for.\\nI was tasked to purchase a fridge for the office.  I was able to find something easily on-line which fit our budget.  I purchased the item then realized it was not the full size fridge we initially wanted.  Since the fridge had not yet been delivered, I worked with customer service to exchange the item in our order.   The exchange went very smoothly and on the appointed day, the new fridge was delivered.  Easy-peasy!\\nI found greenvelope very user friendly. Highly recommend it.\\nTried tu publish comment from a company i Work with and they erased my comment, where is the free speech? why it needs to go under supervision if what i say is what i want all to know, as I´m sure they will erase this post cause of this bad review.\\nThe labels were not acceptable. I called customer service and the representative refused to re-do the labels. I am not happy with Walter Drake’s performance or lack of commitment to customer service. Next time I need labels, or something else, I will never again use Walter Drake.\\nWas looking for a lower priced alternative to buying ink.  Tried Inkfarm.  Good price, quick delivery.  Cartridge works.  Just what I had hoped.\\nFast service and very easy to navigate website!\\nVery easy with many options\\nAt checkout you will get surprise. My flowers were supposed to be $79 USD and ended up to be 128.25 at check out. $50 rebate email never comes. \\r\\nNext the Flowers were not delivered to the Funeral home. I have called 5 times and 5 times I was transferred to a non existent supervisor and after 15 minutes on hold was prompted to leave a voice mail. Voice mails are not answered and emails are not returned . Total Scam as far as I can see.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim A\\r\\nFort Pierce Florida\\nThis was my first time booking thru JustFly.com and I was very satisfied with their service. There were no hidden fees and the price was perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. I will recommend Just Fly to everyone. Great service.\\nI tried to cancel an order and it did not candle it now I have 8 things to send back. Please look into it. You would have gotten a 5 star from me.\\nGreat prices!  Great customer service!  Great products! Thank you for coming to DFW!\\nI used the website and went to pick up the item the next day.  It was simple and I would do it again.\\nFast delivery\\nBradley came over and was able to fix our door and we now feel safer!\\r\\nThanks Bradley!\\nHad the parts I needed in stock\\nThe customer service team was extremely helpful and experienced while showing us our storage area and explaining our contract.\\nGreat quality printing!\\nReliable, easy, and good rate. 3day-free option is real cost-saving!\\nGood place to go for people with bad credit I kept telling then I was just going to waste their time because of my credit then next thing you know I\\'m driving off the lot thanks to Nicole at the citrus heights location\\nI have done most of my Christmas shopping on Gettington and all but one item will be here in time for Christmas but that one item may still make it. Most of my items have shipped earlier than originally thought and I am happy with everything I have received.\\nThey had exactly what I wanted and needed, I was so surprised when my order arrived within a couple of days, Great service! Their prices are very reasonable compared to other sites.  My only problem was with a folding reacher/grabber.  When open it is very wobbly where it folds, but that is the manufacturer\\'s fault.  I am very pleased with this company and will definitely order again!\\nAlexis gave the best customer service available at the Southfield store I would recommend that store to anyone that I know.\\nOur travel consultant was very knowledgeable and helpful. However he and us had difficulty with SkyLux\\'s processing of our credit card payment. Capitalone initially knocked back the payment because their computers were suspicious of the nationality and nature of the charge. After my phone calls to them they approved the transaction. SkyLux would be well advised to look into how they handle credit card payments.\\nGreat books, low price pretty fast delivery\\nOne of my favorite sites for selecting optimal hotel accommodations.\\nOverall the reservation experience was great.  There seemed to be some lag time between data entry and it appearing on the screen and also when  moving between screens.  However, the templates were user friendly.\\nI love Groupon so happy with every order I order thanks Groupon for your awesome service will be ordering again soon.\\nOver all the loan went smooth and very fast , very pleased with the service\\nI liked my dress it was the right size and 10dollarmall.com will definitely receive more business for me.\\nThese guys are the real deal! $200 more than Gazelle for my MacBook and they were nice, responsive, and organized.  Amazing experience!!!\\nThis was my second order with Flashbay. My sales rep, Sophia, went out of her way to keep me informed as to the status of my order. The shipping was fast and the order arrived exactly as expected. I will be ordering from Flashbay again!\\nAfter comparing this product with other sites offering similar items I thought this was the best value for money.  Shipping was very efficient (to Canada) and arrived earlier than expected, which was perfect as it was a gift.  Canvas looks great!\\nI\\'ve been using Home Advisor for a while.  the contractors are a mixed back or have mixed performance.  I\\'ve gained 2 reliable contractors.  I\\'ve also had contractors start the job to find they don\\'t have the experience, bail the project for other jobs, be rude, leave the job unfinished.\\n  \\nAs a Business Analyst/Project Manager It would be good if Home Advisor could either provide an optional project management or tracking service or open the door to project managers to offer their services as an addition to projects.  A third party establishing the needs and performance and end result of the job could be helpful and establishing better contractor motivation, reliability and quality.\\nGreat service, speedy delivery & item arrived in excellent condition.\\nTaught me everything I needed to know with fun moments to keep me engaged.\\nBought Goethia. The only drawback was that it smells somewhat of  cigarette smoke, but that should dissipate with time. The order came in quickly and there were no problems.\\nThis is a nice facility for storage.  \\r\\nTheir personnel are very friendly.  Dennison at the front desk was extremely helpful and always service with manners and a smile.  The storage rooms seem decently clean and I would give a 5 star if it wasn\\'t for the floors in the spaces that we rented.  It needed better sweeping, that\\'s all.  I had lots of furtniture and wanted a clean place to storage them. No dust.  Other than that, I recommend this facility to anyone whose looking for a nice storage place.\\nGood price and easy purchase.\\nGreat place to stay\\nEasy access to downtown but not in the thick of things\\nEverything we needed at the house\\nI was happy with the product and it was sent timely.\\nGreat prices\\nthank you so much for going above and beyond and getting the bracelet I needed!

Love  Just Fab. Thank you\\nGood easy booking process.  I have not parked, but so far, excellent.\\nI always enjoy booking through Priceline. I get great rooms at affordable prices. I have tried other companies,  but none are as easy to use as Priceline.\\nIn the future we are planning to have more work as soon as we have the money and you will be the people we call.\\nGreat survey site!Fun surveys,generous rewards!\\nI love everything about this company!\\nSo the prices are already lower then a gnc, and you get tons of free stuff like shakers and samples.  I ordered from here based on my friends recommendation, and so far it seems to be excellent.  I will probably order from here again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope this helps someone\\nYou have a great product but can you have a representative in Singapore? Makes purchasing easier.\\nFittings good and looks classy.\\nI had some mats cut and was happy with the final product, but they were custom and I had a fair bit of frustration along the way.  I began by going to the shop hoping they could easily help me with 3 different designs, but I ended up wasting 45 mins on each of 2 different trips.  I ended up designing the layout on my own on my laptop.  \\n\\nI was very surprised they don\\'t have software to help with this.  I also suspect that a new employee was working with me, and I think someone more experienced should have noticed that she/we needed help and come to the rescue.\\nThe order delivered was absolutely nothing like the one pictured on their site.  I ordered the Soothing Lavender bouquet along with a stuffed teddy bear and 3 balloons. All of the items were upgraded to a cost of $110.  When I spoke to the agent I was very specific about the color and bear and all was confirmed.  The next day I received a call to return their call. After holding 45 minutes I was told that some of the lavender flowers were not available.  I ok substitution on some of the flowers and reconfirmed the medium sized teddy and the lavender vase.  What was delivered was a substandard bouquet of mixed colored flowers with a polka dot ribbon and a stuffed pony fit for a five year of with only one ballon.   I contacted Avas and again held for over  45 minutes.  Their resolution was to give me a $20 credit!  My next step is to file a complaint with the better business bureau.\\nProm Girl is a great site! Lots of dresses to choose from at great prices. Loved the dress we got, true to size and made well.\\nThey make you pay for a return they list things that are not actually compatible with cars and take forever to help you\\ngot it on time.\\nI\\'ve gotten some really great books in almost perfect condition for about 3 or 4 dollars a piece! I have gotten 1 wrong book delivered and instead of sending me a replacement, I just got a refund. But I usually wait to order until I can get a pretty decent haul so I don\\'t have to pay for shipping. Have also gotten some books without the covers even though it doesn\\'t state that in description\\nThey seem to be an honest seller who delivers what they promise. I have purchased Microsoft Office multiple times from My Choice Software, and each time it has downloaded and installed just fine. Had a little trouble with getting it activated online (it\\'s an older version of office, not the resellers fault) they helped me right through that.\\nOrdering great. Speed of delivery great. Quality of products very very poor. Atleast two-thirds of my order were split cracked or missing large chunks.\\nTownfair in Johnston RI has a terrific\\r\\nStaff, knowledgeable, courteous, and punctual.  I will definitely use this location again for all my tire needs.\\nGave me adhesive strips to hang my canvas and it ripped the paint off my walls.\\nI purchased these fun T-shirts for our family Christmas fun on Christmas day.  They are great quality and I\\'m very happy with them! Can\\'t wait to see everyone wearing them Christmas Day!!\\nServiz was very responsive to my request for a quote, made themselves available on short notice. They booked the job on the best day for me.  The floors have never looked better, Andrew did a great job.\\nIt\\'s Fixed Computer Repair offers great tech support with accuracy and thoroughness. As a local law firm, we rely heavily on their comprehensive knowledge in computer networking, cyber threats and internal software. This company is true to it\\'s brand by guaranteeing trouble shooting measures and problem solving within our office network. Important downloads and virus issues are handled professionally and IMMEDIATELY! They are an accessible and reliable company to work with and we HIGHLY recommend them for any office environment.\\nThe lamp part I ordered worked perfectly!\\nI received my shipment on time, however I ordered a size 12 -18 month baby onesie and received a 18 - 24 month instead, which is *much* too big. As I was hoping to use it for a specific occasion, I did not have time to reorder the proper size in time, which left me scrambling to find something else.\\nI have decided not to return the item, as it will fit down the road, and I am satisfied with the quality etc otherwise.\\nWent to Philadelphia through CityPASS in October 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really like the aspect that we planned a few days longer than our tickets lasted.  That way, we used up the tickets in the first several days in the city, then used the last couple days to visit things we saw while traveling between the CityPASS ticket venues.  In Philadelphia in particular, there is an upgrade on the Philadelphia Trolly Works and Big Bus Company ticket from a 2 day ride pass to an 8 day ride pass.  I strongly recommend this upgrade as it will make getting around the city much cheaper and easier (as you can park at the Constitution Center all day and ride from there instead of finding your own way everywhere).\\nI bought the Bushnell as a Father\\'s Day gift and the look on my hsuband\\'s face said it all. Loved it.\\nEVERYTHING I EXPECTED,OVERALL VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT.\\nI was extremely skeptical when I was trying to get my sprint iPhone unlocked. I mean anyone would be. I decided to take the leap of faith with these guys and it was like magic. Worked amazing. The ad said 5-7 days. It took a little bit longer than that but I didn\\'t mind the wait especially since they emailed me every few days with an update and if there was an issue they emailed me about that too. Plus the tracker On the website let me know exactly what was going on. After about 9 days I got an email saying my phone was unlocked. Sure enough I put my sim in and it was all good. Will definitely be using these guys next time I need an unlock service.\\nIn the time I have had Regcure I have experienced no difficuties at all\\nJackThreads has a great collection and I got a pair of Levis from them. It was well under the original price. Only problem is that it took about a week longer than I had expected. Great overall experience though.\\nWithin seconds a person answered the phone, knew who I was without asking anything (by phone number) and helped me change the order I had just placed. I was off the phone within 2 minutes. Very easy, friendly and helpful. I have never been so impressed! Keep it up!\\nSent the wrong part  then wanted me to drive out of town to send it back pay for shipping and restock fee. For only half of what I paid for\\nI spoke with Mr Patrick Wallace, the talk since the begining was not just friendly, was direct, clear answers, clear questions, not cutting corners, I told Patrick what I need , Patrick told me what he need it, and with that info, I got my proposal withing few hours. That is the way I like to do business. Good Job Mr Wallace.

That is when I will be able to tell if you guys are good or not.\\nIn my experience: i call may family very often and Rebtel is a better company because is safety,  fast, i do not have to use PIN number of any other code, and sometimes i get free minutes to use.\\nI have ordered before from this company and the order arrives in a very timely manner.The prices are reasonable.I won\\'t hesitate to order again from them.\\nexcellent and fast service, good prices\\nLove your late Sunday night Customer Service for ordering.  Two orders so far.  The lady always cheerfully answers the phone. She is the greatest.  Such dedication, working so late!\\n\\nThe grapefruit are fantastic.  You have just gained a lifetime customer.  Please note though that I am 81, so that\\'s not a real big offer for you.\\nI did alot of research on the net about silk sheets, LilySilk had the best reviews from others so I took the chance. Boy they did not dissapoint with the quality. Absolutely a great investment I made as I am making more of a investment in my sleep. Bought the fiteed sheets with the top sheet and 2 pillow cases. Comfortable, keeps me cool and the fabric feels great agaianst your skin. Shipping was good, not long, within a week I believe. I have not washed them yet but will be meticulous cause I don\\'t want to ruin them. Will buy the Duvet when I save a little more.\\nSky in California customer service helped me with getting the colors just right.\\nI only ordered samples as of now. They were reasonably priced but some of them were so small it’s hard to get a true sense of the full pallet of colors that comprise a bigger swatch.\\nThe book came ahead of time and was a very good price. I wish it was in a bit better condition.\\ni ORDERED A PART BUT BEFORE I ORDERED I HAD A QUESTION IF IT WOULD FIT. I HAVE A TAURUS X AND ON THE WEB SITE IT CAME UP WITH THE PART FOR A PLAIN TAUIRUS. I SENT A REQUEST FOR HELP THE E-MAIL I GOT BACK GAVE ME A PART # AND I ORDERED. IT APPEARS THE COUSTOMER SERVICE MEMBER WHO RESPONDED TO MY REQUEST DID NOT READ IT OR DOES NOT KNOW THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN TAURUS AND TAURUS X , A SUV.\\nBoth were a huge hit with my kids.  Excellent!!\\nConvenient and easy to use. Eliminates the need to physically appear at the Embassy or Consulate as well as the time consuming application by mail.\\nI have been shopping online with Thriftbooks for just about a year now after my eldest daughter found out about it at school.  It is a wonderful site for finding quality used books at a great price!  We are usually shopping for books for school or research, but Thriftbooks has a very large selection of many genres!  I particularly love the wish list feature, which allows you to be contacted if they do not currently have a book in stock.  Even the most obscure title I\\'ve been looking for has been located on this site.  I also love their fast shipping, which is usually free depending on your order total (it\\'s easy to get free shipping with so many great books to choose from!).  I will use this site often, and highly recommend them!\\nAlways a great product and excellent customer service.\\nI bought my first pair of glasses from firmoo and I actually bought the wrong frames. I contacted firmoo and they got back to me in a couple of hours on a weekday which I was impressed by and they helped me exchange my glasses without any issues. They dispatched the glasses with my prescription quickly too which I was also very impressed by as most online stores take atleast 2 weeks.\\n\\nUPDATE: I bought my glasses and has been roughly 2 weeks and my glasses have broken. I am very disappointment in the quality and build. I will not be buying from this company again. It was probably why they were free.\\nOverall not bad for trying to get a better rate on a loan. Only drawback is that it took a long time to approve, compared to other sites.\\nthank you very much for this sevices\\nJust rubbish. They allegedly aggregate pricing from various hotels etc, but the prices displayed are just bait. We found time and time again we\\'d go through to pay the listed price, to find the end price was nothing like first quoted and had to bail - example - list price for a Dubai hotel $1.6k, actual price $2.7k. Ditto applies to their airfares too - screen price, $8.2k, actual end price $11.6k. \\n\\nI rang their help line and formally complained, they weren\\'t prepared to honour the fares quoted, apparently it\\'s the airline\\'s fault...  In the end we concluded it is just a dishonest click-bait service.\\nI was very happy to have been covered by RoamRight during our trip to Italy and Switzerland. Even though we didn\\'t have to use it, I was very comfortable knowing it was in place in case of an unexpected problem arose. \\r\\n\\r\\nI injured my foot two days before the trip was over and got home safe, but had it happened in the beginning of the trip I would have used the insurance t get me home early. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeace of mind is worth a lot.\\nI had and awesome experience for the 2nd time, this time around the only problem I had is with the delivery guys. But it was was handled with a call in.\\nGreat products and great service\\nGreat price and quality product and easy to reach for info after purchase.\\nI\\'ve always been a Lulu lemon girl and my friend let me try on her fabulous fabletics and I was instantly hooked. Great quality, comfort and prints. So happy. I\\'ve already bought 4 pair!\\nWhen I called the hotel, I was quoted 15 days of parking at no additional charge. This site had less days. Why is the night I stay counted as a day of parking?\\nEfficient website. Easy ordering. Good communication. Delivery as promised.colors are a little more muted on the products than in the photos on the website but the quality in every other respect was good.\\nGreat process and service!\\nLooking forward to use the apt!!!\\nAfter placing 3 orders on Revzilla, which eventually got cancelled because they wouldn\\'t accept credit card payment for the first order and they wanted me to do a bank transfer, which is a nightmare to do from my country, I finally placed my order for the Arai helmet on Sportbiketrackgear and paid by PayPal. The order was instantly approved and I received it within 4 days, just before my ride to Goa for the India Bike Week. I\\'m impressed.\\nI ordered two items, and received an email two days later that my items have shipped. I opened the email only to find that the one item was cancelled because it was out of stock. I went onto their website and saw that the item said it was in stock, so I called to see whether they would be able to fulfill my order. After being on hold for quite some time a woman answered and rudely told me she needed my credit card number to order the item that was in fact in stock. After I got off of the phone with the woman, I added up the two separate amounts I paid and realized I was paying more than I was initially. After calling back and waiting again, the woman put me on hold to check why the prices were different. She then preceded to tell me that it was their mistake and that I should have paid more initially, but that it was their problem. However, she said that the new total was correct. I told her that I did not think it was fair that I pay more when it was their mistake, but she could care less. I said that I was very unhappy and that it was not right of them to do and that I wouldn\\'t be ordering from them again, and she responded with \"Go talk.\" Never have I ever dealt with such horrible customer service. Don\\'t order from this company, nobody should be treated so disrespectfully.\\nGreat instructions, and helpful assist after hours from John Murray in Network Operations when a UPS label wasn\\'t working.   This can\\'t get much easier.   Thanks to John and Johanna Jablon in getting my passport on time.\\nI compared all online agents. Just fly prices was by far the best\\nI admit it took a little longer than what I anticipated but once I was able to provide what they asked for, it moved quickly. The representative was very nice and explained everything very well. I had read reviews where people said they were asked for all these things and  then were not approved. I was fearful of that happening and then so elated when I got my approval. I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a quick loan.\\nI didn\\'t have any difficulty getting my books. I ordered them at home and had them sent to my mailbox at school, and they where there when I got there. Perfect.\\nKabbage cared about my needs not just about making money. They asked all the right questions and came to my aid quick\\nThe staff was very helpful and accommodating.  We got our products promptly.\\nI love priceline the app is easy to use/navigate love the features I.e express deals and name your price. I only use this app when planning a trip.\\nGreat and efficient experience!\\nEasy, fast and reliable\\nThey had the books I was looking for and I thought the price was fair too.\\nThis store has got the WORST customer service. Never in my life have I     been treated in a store so rudely. I had someone bringing me a pair of boots and since they work on commission no one else was able to help me with another pair. That first guy was nowhere to be seen, and finally he came I was holding a few more styles that I wanted to try and he was like those are not available in your size. Those are the last pairs, and he was gone without even looking at them. So I proceeded to try on the floor sample boots which were my size actually, and then another guy (or maybe it was the same) came and grabbed all the boots away. You can\\'t try on floor sample boots. \\r\\n\\r\\nI settled on two boots that I wanted and tried again to ask anybody else to bring me the boots and to even just tell me the price. Nobody wanted to help me. Finally the original rude salesman came back, and he said he will bring it for me. He brought me only one, and he was gone. I tried again to locate him, and finally I did. I asked where is the other one. He said you can only try on one at a time. I am like: HU? I want to compare them!!! He said he will lose his job, if I want to try on another one together. So I asked him to speak to the manager. He said she should be around here. So I said can you please show me where. He said I can\\'t call her. I asked again and this time he said she\\'s on lunch. I said you don\\'t start that with me, so he said oh there she is. She was standing right in back of me the entire time. RUDEST, NASTIEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!\\nExcellent car rental in service and worth of money. Got the car I ordered, a clean and relatively new car. 2 weeks with no problems.\\nTesting.com has helped my kids to acheive high scores in their academic. My son has improved a lot in Math as well as the way he should understand the questions to solve the problems in more strategic ways. He\\'s more confident and comfortable while writing tests at school.\\nTerrible. Will not be coming back. First, when shuttle driver arrived at lot, he jumped out to get one of the passengers keys who was valet parked. He kept the entire shuttle of people waiting over 5 minutes while he must have been searching for the keys....and gave us no explanation of what he was doing, before Or after. \\nNext, when I get up to the checkout there are 2 cars in front of me and 1 cashier working. No problem, except cashier must have had a disagreeemnt with car at window. It took about over 10 minutes for that one car to get checked out. No kidding.\\nExact as ordered plus quick shipping\\nEverything went perfect with the entire transaction.\\nThis was my first time booking on Justfly.com and it was the best value that i was able to find and was a seamless process!!

I was not happy about putting my house hold goods in any storage rental for personal reason\\'s not that Public Storage Rental is a bad place, just because of my personal life reasons.\\r\\nAll I\\'m going to say is, DO NOT EVER GET RID OF LAUREN!!! Give that girl a raise and take care of her, more businesses need more of her, she was excellent and made me laugh, I almost offered her a job working in property management that\\'s how good she was, she is smart knows her job and has excellent customer service, even being left alone on a very busy Saturday, she\\'s wonderful and If I could give her a job, I AM!!!\\nThis was exactly what I expected.

Upon using the search tool I decided to search the first credit union I was ever a member of. The search tool worked very quickly and very accurately. I was rather surprised at the speed. The tool provided the exact result I was looking for immediately. I did not even have to type in the full name of the credit union. The result I was looking for was also the top hit in the search results. Overall, this search tool works incredibly well.\\nListed three businesses and customer reviews and ratings which helped me make a decision on what company to hire.\\nThis is my 3rd year using OptiContacts.

This vendor had water and i could buy it by the case.

We were also told that they can\\'t give us back ups until the server is restored, which make me wonder if they really have a back up. HostGator has had zero communication with us and when I call they direct me to their forum. Where is the disaster recovery plan?!? If you have a backup put it on a new server/restore an image of the downed server. I have a hard time believing that this is only affecting a \"few\" customers. Their hold time has been 30 min plus and their chat over an hour and they are definitely NOT in communication with customers. Over the last few days we have experienced the WORST customer experience we have ever had and we will never do business with HostGator again, not because of the problem but because of the way it is being handled.\\nGreat wines at great prices!\\nThe site publishes your review as it is. No editing and without taking sides. When there is a reply or a comment related to your review, you get notified and have always a chance to edit/update your review.\\nI find it easy to use, very intuitive and serving a great cause. I would not change anything. Thank you\\nI have ordered from cafepress before: they have a fantastic selection of products for special occasions, comedy/fun, and riske phrases/images (my personal favourite).  The item prices AND shipping (to Canada) are very reasonable, the quality is great, and my orders are received FAST.  I do a lot of online shopping and have always been super pleased with my purchases from cafepress, which is why I keep coming back.  I recommend this company and their products to everyone - you\\'re sure to find what you want and won\\'t be disappointed.  Awesome every time!!\\nThey Amazon Warehouse deals sent me a beat up book when I paid for a new one.\\nI will definitely get a New York Pass the next time I visit NYC. It saved me time and money during my last visit to NYC. It\\'ll be great if they will add more attractions to the list of the already long list (for e.g., Statue of Liberty should be a great addition) to make it an excellent value.\\nSuper-fast shipping, very responsive customer service, and their extensive array of photos of all products leave no doubts whatsoever about what you are ordering. Worry-free shopping experience all the way around!\\nI think my biggest issue with your site and checkout experience is that you do not reward the user in any way for purchasing. No customer loyalty, no free shipping when you buy x-amount, no points, nothing. You are engaging in an exchange of value with me, the customer, and literally bringing NOTHING to the table except the product and high shipping costs. \\n\\nIn this specific case your store had a monopoly on the 6.5ft anodized Klus Micro, as it did on my first purchase. And when I returned to get a little more, your site treated me like I didn\\'t already give you money, I got the same experience as the initial purchase, nothing special, no reward. This makes your company forgettable at best. Please don\\'t let your site be this way, your bottom line is being drastically affected by your poorly developed ecommerce experience. \\n\\nYour Trust Pilot survey is almost an admittance that you don\\'t know anything about what your customers want from you. Well here\\'s what they want, a memorable purchase experience, some reason to come back, a little FOMO, some specials, deals, or coupons, loyalty rewards, free shipping... you guys figure out a way to get any of these working and you will start seeing far more loyal and repeat customers (aside from myself who cut a length of light strip channel wrong and am currently forced to buy from you)\\n\\nYour developers are using PHP, they can bind a few extra fields of metadata to users and reward, interact, and incentivize your customers... if not, get yourself some new developers.\\nMy auto ship orders are very convenient arriving at my front door on schedule.  PetFlow has everything you could possibly need or want for your pets.\\nbe honest, UpRight has the compassion\\nOutstanding facility; exceptional service.\\neasy to use for anyone\\n...................................\\nEasy ordering experience.\\nThe hard part was deciding what to order since there were so many choices. Everything went well. I would order again from them.\\nSuppWarehouse is definitely one of the top go-to supplement companies.  They have it all (most of the time), prices are good and I\\'ve had great experiences with their customer service. This company has been around a long time and their drive to improve their on all fronts is noticeable and appreciated.\\nI ordered a few times with Pureformulas. Most of the orders were shipped on the same day as they mentioned.  Only one time they delayed my order for a few days.  I can say I\\'m happy with my shopping with PureFormulas.\\nI\\'m always happy with the service that u have, I bought a new pre work out with my protein powder and it\\'s amazing thanks guys\\nMy experience was  great. Felicia took time to clarify and terms and deductions that were  unclear. Everyone was professional and efficient.\\nBiggest processing fee in the business.  They hit the buyer and seller with a processing fee.  Terrible to deal with the customer service when something goes wrong.  The just keep repeating what ever their response sheet tells them to say without actually responding to your question.\\nI ordered a candy I\\'ve been wanting for years. When I ordered it the site said they had 2 left in stock. A few weeks later I\\'m notified that my order was canceled cause the item was no longer in stock. They never took their money which is good, but I was disappointed that I didn\\'t get my item when it\\'s very hard to find.\\nI recently purchased a laptop. This was on Nov 15, 2015. Nov 17 the money came out of my account so on the 20th I checked online since I had not received any email about shipping, only an email confirming the order was received. It said the laptop was delivered to Jefferson, GA. Note I live in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada and the order was placed at TigerDirect.ca. I called and was told that this is standard. It is delivered to Tiger Direct warehouse and then shipped on to the customer and that it would now be routed directly to me and I would receive an email. That was 2 days ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever heard a thing so started sending emails to customer service. Eventually they cancelled the order stating the item was lost between the cross dock. However didn\\'t refund me some $15.62 for shipping and some other laptop charge. Now after another few emails I will receive $13. Then a few more and another $1.46. Finally after sending another email that the missing money they had charged for laptop disposal I will receive another $1.15. So only lost $0.01 and spent time sending 9 emails trying to get a solution to my order. Worst company I have ever dealt with online. I Will never deal with them again, neither will my company nor anyone I can suggest to buy elsewhere. Please do not waste your time shopping here. Customer service is a joke.\\nDelivering to Holland can be very slow sometimes. But prices of the product are excelent. Quality of the product vary. There is a lot of junk, that\\'s true, but also very handy cheap gadgets for incredible prices. \\r\\nFree international sending costs are incredible too!\\r\\nVery good customer service. Understandable, and I get refunds easily, but not fast. They will ask you to wait a few times for a few weeks first. Maybe it\\'s because I am a good client, why the customer service is very kind to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do recommend it.\\nShipping service is unreliable.\\n\\nMany errors on the website pertaining to product information.\\n\\nOnly reason I shop here is because of the good selection of parts.\\nGreat quality items, super prices!

Easy to track parcel and delivered quickly.  Have used before and also great service then. A business it is safe to trust.  One of my favourites.\\nWell the place that installed wasn\\'t to helpful to me, the unit that was put in my car doesn\\'t beep when it time to blow into the unit, I have to keep taking my eyes off the road to keep checking to see if the blow sign is lite, there was a few times when I almost had and accident by looking down to see if it\\'s time to blow into the unit, I texted the company about this problem but haven\\'t heard from them, other that that I have nothing else to say about intoxalock until they fix this problem,  I will keep on trying to get in contact with them.\\nExcellent offers great value\\nWe had a great experience with The Futon Shop.  The salesman was very thorough and helpful, without being pushy.  And we are very happy with our mattress.  We\\'ve slept great since it arrived, and we don\\'t wake up stuffy and congested like we did with our old mattress.

This should have been plenty of time for my booking to be reviewed and any refund returned as the flight was two months away. \\n\\nI was notified I should receive 200 euros back on a 1,157 dollar flight. I never received this money. Under their own rules, I should have a refund from the U.S. based flights if not the other international flights as this was cancelled within 24 hours. This is in their own rules! I should have gotten at least 739.58 dollars refunded. I did not receive this, and I doubt Kiwi.com even attempted to get this back. \\n\\nI tried over and over to get in contact with a person by phone and through the company site. Nothing. Considering how bad this company is, I shouldn\\'t be surprised they don\\'t want to deal with all their angry customers. \\n\\nI am beyond angry and disappointed.

If I could upload a photo I would, but nope. I went over the offer email, the confirmation email, the follow up email....nowhere. So before you respond incorrectly to try and feign interest, like you are actively aware of your customers, speak the truth. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso - please be honest about why you stopped credit card tipping - it is to save YOU taxes...no other reason. Even the checkout guy admitted that to me, as would anyone. I don\\'t care that much, until you responded with complete dishonesty - don\\'t you understand most customers just want the truth? \\r\\n\\r\\nI also stopped going there because you lost all the decent massage therapists to other places because you were terrible to work for. I know this time she straight out of school, so I won\\'t be surprised when she is gone in a few months. \\r\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nMy massage was great!!! the massage therapist was amazing, and very nice. When i go to checkout I find out they don\\'t allow tips on the credit card (they used to, so this was new to me). since I live around the corner I had gone with just my phone and credit card, not my atm card, and told him I didn\\'t have an atm card on me. He proceeded to chastise me and tell me it was \"CLEARLY written in all emails and appointment reminders\" I looked at all my emails and appt reminders, it was NOWHERE to be found. I pointed that out to him, he said \"oh, well, I will be sure to let my general manager know\" and then I found a $5 I had and said, at least I can leave this until I can come back with cash. He said \"Well, at leasst it is sooooommmmething\"  - sorry YOU failed to make your policy known ahead of time\\nGreat prices and selections\\nIt was wonderful\\nExcellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.\\nEthin waited on me a couple months ago and was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about what type of tires to buy for my daughters car.

Totally recommend this, if planning a visit to 2 or more of the stops in the booklet.\\nThe best my mummy love it\\nNever been disappointed with my purchases, excellent prices and prompt delivery.\\nI have been on the system for 2 1/2 weeks.  I lost 10 pounds the first week and was diligent.  The second week I gained a pound and that left me deflated.  I am maintaining at the second weeks gain and just feel my body wants to just hold on to the fat I have carried for so long.  Today I am trying to not do anything wrong, so we will see.  I\\'m not fond of all the food as I am not a \"sweet tooth\" type of person and everything seems to be coated with sugar. I am eating my own cheerios in the morning as the NS one\\'s are too sweet.  I hope this is ok.  I also seem to be more hungry than I was when I wasn\\'t on the NS diet.  I am hungry every minute.   I don\\'t like shakes and I don\\'t like many bars and I have a ton of them left.  My husband says just choke them down.  Hah, easy for him to say as he sits and eats his pizza!!!!\\na lot of days to wait\\nPlaque ordered online and came few days later in mail.  Great quality and nicer than expected\\neasy and affordable\\nDid not know that they require a signature (because they dont insure anything) before your stuff can be left at your house. There was no warning of any kind that i could see about this prior to placing order. The reason that they do this is so they can say that if anything happens to ur stuff while sitting on ur door step they dont have to help u out ( isnt this what insurance is for). They told me that they wouldnt refund my money due to the ingraving. Well folks as long as u paid with a credit card and ur purchase was more then $50 you can call up ur cc com and tell them thr item never showed up so u just tell them to do a charge back and they take the money back from them and credit ur credit  card and u get ur money back\\nThe darn sticker has such a strong glue on it that it rips the book apart when it\\'s removed.  Thrift books should use a less potent glue.\\nKelly was amazing in organising my trip to London. \\nI had a hassle free trip. Loved my Business Class. \\nThank you 😊\\nExceptional service.........!\\nExcellent service and beautiful products.  Hard to find Cavalier King Charles Spaniel items, but this site has tons of beautiful items of this breed.  They two throws I ordered are very large, printed on both sides and nice fabric.

It is only in a rare moment that I must be in a specific hotel or room that I do not.\\nvery good service\\nI ordered Voltron (1985 Modern) comics issue #\\'s 1 and 2 from MyComicShop. My son purchased and sent to me Voltron (1985 Modern) issue #3 as a gift; so I needed issues 1 and 2 to complete the issue set.  I am a die-hard Voltron and retro 80\\'s toy fan.  MyComicShop made the sale transaction efficient and packaged and shipped both comics ordered with the utmost care; I received both in near mint condition.  I highly recommend purchasing from MyComicShop and definitely look forward to doing business with this company in the near future!  Thank you MyComicShop for a pleasant buying experience!\\nWe used dial 7 to and from LaGuardia recently and were very impressed with their organization and punctuality. Receiving a text with instructions once my plane landed was very helpful.The drivers were courteous and safe and the cars were immaculate. My only complaint is that the cost was significantly more each way than what was projected. The driver seemed to make the price up on the spot and didn\\'t use my coupon code. Overall, it was a great experience and we would use them again.\\neEuroparts  has all the parts and help I need to keep my SAAB 9000 doing \\r\\nwhat it does best!!\\nAmazing products, super fast shipping and great variety of sizes!

There was a problem with the item, but buydig stepped up with a solution and advice.\\nAs a six foot three inch tall woman, I have been a customer of Long Tall Sally for years.

It is absolutely beautiful and my daughter in law loves it!\\nPlaced my order and within a week, it arrived. I received my complete and accurate order for a price that was below anywhere else I looked. I couldn\\'t be happier with my decision.\\nI am so aggravated with this place!!  I placed an order with them last Thursday morning.  The order was shipped to USPS on Monday and did not leave that facility until today (Thursday).  I do NOT understand why I am going to be out of my medicine for 3 days now, because they cant get their orders out in a timely manner.  If I had the money to get my medicine from a local pharmacy, I would never deal with HW again!!  Every time I order, it is always the same thing!!!  I am tired of running out of medicine!!!!\\nStarting with an easy web page to browse thru, right thru the installation it was  easy AND cheaper than the local auto parts!\\r\\nThe parts arrived when they said and all were top quality with a perfect fit.

They were all very helpful, friendly and super efficient. I am a first time home buyer and Quicken make me feel very comfortable with the whole process. I would highly recommend them!!!\\nFound item I needed but shipping is a bit high. Not sure what return process is..so I feel I\\'m taking a risk.\\nShipping took forever! Maybe indicate more realistic shipping time for Australian customers. Otherwise excellent service and good website.\\nI appreciate the ability to get my answers answered quickly and accurately. Although I have only been using TherapyNotes for five months, it has really streamlined my practice and allows me to focus on counseling and less on documentation and billing.

I had never heard of them but their reviews seemed promising and I needed something fast for an event my company was holding. Shortly after placing my order I received an email from Chef Stephen to confirm my delivery which I\\'m so glad he did because had he not I would have not gotten them in time for my event. Chef Stephen also resolved the issue to make sure I received it on time. Impressed by the customer service. Also when I received the cookies they were Beautiful. I was so impressed, and they tasted amazing. We will defiantly be using them again. Thank you.\\nThe camera package I bought dropped in price by $50 two days after I made my purchase, but they wouldn\\'t offer any type of refund or price-match. Which is clearly stated under their policies, so they did nothing wrong. However, it makes me wary of future purchases.\\n\\nOn the plus side, it was still a nice package price; and the various items arrived quite quickly and safely.\\nConvenient for direct bank deposit even if its holidays both california and philippines.\\nFast and reliable service\\nBest way to find cheap books!\\nNavel oranges are especially good   this year.

I have used it for over 5 years anc would not practice without it.\\n\\nTeresa Helms, Psy.D.\\nTown Center Psychology PLLC\\nI ordered a bracelet from Reeds Jewelers rather than ordering direct from the company that makes the bracelet because Reeds offered free shipping and no tax.  My order was shipped within a matter of hours from ordering and I got it a couple days later.  Would definitely order from Reeds again.  Thank you.\\nCarousel\\'s check registers are very reasonably priced.  My order arrived very quickly.  I\\'m very satisfied.\\nThe shipping could have been faster -- better.  The book edges were creased I guess from the packing and shipping.  Overall experience was just okay.\\nHaving only discovered Enchanting Travels via the internet, I was a little nervous that they would not deliver the service or experience I was expecting.  This fear was put to rest upon our arrival in India where expectations of safe, fun and informative travel were not only met but exceeded.  The guides provided in the different cities will vary in personality and the accommodation will vary is style, to which you may have a personal preference, but that is to be expected.  Considering the driving conditions in India, we thought our driver was legendary! We would definitely consider using Enchanting Travels again in other countries where we do not feel comfortable organising our own land transport (e.g. hire care or public transport) or think we may have issues with breaching the cultural or language divide.\\nI love all of their products. So classy and modern. High quality. Very excited for my purchase to arrive.\\nI love buying gift cards on giftcards.com.  I don\\'t have to leave my desk to buy gifts and don\\'t have to worry that they\\'ve been tampered with in a store.\\nI really like their selection of flowers--I ordered the peony bouquet for my Mom (one of her favorite flowers), I have never seen peonies  offered before, even though they keep well as a cut flower. I also liked the fact that I was notified after delivery.  The arrangements that they offer are definitely more varied than the run of the mill floral stuff.\\nBabyDoppler was great- very quick and easy to order. The product was reliable and very helpful.\\nI received great service and a quality product on time.\\nI love the hill topper; bought the lowest level and am very satisfied with the unit. Great power on a flat grade; just enough power to get up a hill on easiest gears without working too hard. Watch the on line instruction to get things set correctly.\\nI waited 15 minutes, standing outside in the freezing cold for the driver. When I called they said he would be there in 2 minutes. When I called again 10 minutes later they were unhelpful and honestly quite rude. They gave me $5 off, a coupon readily available online, but that was it. Then when I finally got in the car it smelled horrible. I drove the whole way home with the window down, freezing. Terrible service. Using Lyft next time.\\nGreat service! Great products! Great experience...every single time!\\nBest price I\\'ve found for a Litmann Cardiology IV.  Fast engraving, no errors.  Really fast shipping even using standard shipping.\\nI was able to get what I needed and there was no hassle\\nfast delivery and product was as advertised!\\nusually ok, but sometimes refunds should be easier. Also multiple postings of similar offers from vendors, e.g., year later, should be reset so I can buy\\nOur kohls account was hacked while making an online purchase. We were told two new cards would be sent. My husband received his but I didn\\'t. I called and was told it would be sent. Still didn\\'t come. Called and asked to talk to a supervisor and was told it hadn\\'t been sent. Since I it was going to take several weeks, my husband tried to activate his and was told it was an invalid number. Asked to speak with the same supervisor and no one knew who she was. Another concern was with recording while I was waiting. It stated yes rewards customers get ten dollars extra bucks on birthday. I found this not to be true. It is randomly determined.\\nGood experience, easy to speak with a person, the only improvement I would suggest so far is to clear-up confusion on how to measure particular items such as handlebars.\\nBest product on the market and they\\'re still improving it.\\nfast and quick\\nThe catalog selections and prices are very good; appreciated the fact that they kept me informed of the status of the items.\\nI was very nervous about the whole Medicare application process.  I had little or any knowledge at all in what to expect.  Dianne Young (the Medicare Supplement Agent thru Medigap), was exactly who I needed to help make this whole application process a breeze.  She was so helpful, educated me in all questions I had and walked me thru step by step the entire process!  Her kind professionalism and phone call follow ups truly make her outstanding!  :)\\nGood service\\nQuick setup and excellent instructions on how to operate controls.  The tracking was easy to follow and Customer Service is first class!  Best part is the bed is so comfortable and we love the ability to each sit up in bed with the split King.\\nI phoned to inquire about font size for my Rack Card. Kathy assisted me throughout the cancellation of my initial Rack Card order and the re-ordering process and provided professional and knowledgeable support.  I really appreciated her patience and eagerness to help.\\nShe is a great ambassador Zazzle!\\nLinda\\nI must say that the exceeded every one of my expectations. I went to the College of Wizardy at the request of my girlfriend. I always wanted to try a larp but always had reservations about going head first into it. They made me feel comfortable and gave me one of the best experiences of my life. I am going again in December.  I fully recommend trying it out. They have created an extremely frierndly community to help answer your questions and are quick to respond.\\nThe price was definitely the reason for chosing MrChewy.com. I am not sure what caused the treats in the bag to be broken into a lot of pieces. Maybe he shipping company caused it ? That would be my only complaint. May have to put more packeting around the treat bags. Received merchadise promptly. Good communications.\\nQuick service .Recommend them highly.\\nI have been using docvacay for about 2 years now and I don\\'t have any issues. The providers I found through this site are reliable and professional.\\nI love the clothing it is very comfortable, has not ever felt sticky while excersicing on hot days, or strenuous workouts.  \\nWould LIKE to see a \"save for later\" or \"wish list\" on web site. \\n\\nKeep healthy, \\nJap16\\nAlthough I have to admit the prices are very competitive, the site itself is a chore to deal with. The main issue is the Make Bundle tab which doesn\\'t load any games for the bundles for about a month now. The trade center to me is incomprehensible and the bouncing background when I scroll is annoying. Decent games for the drop keys I have to say.\\nThe Provence Off the Beaten Path tour with Christy was one of our very favorite trips ever! Every detail was taken care of and we toured like locals! The group we were with was small and we had the best time sharing this experience with new traveling friends! It would not have been the same traveling alone. \\n\\nOur hotel was lovely, all resturants were what you would hope for. We were able to hike, tour a winery, and do so many things that would\\'ve been so difficult to coordinate on our own. \\n\\nWe toured (with our daughters) with a well known tour company that is very well regarded a few years later and this tour with Christy made their tour look like (honestly) an expensive bad joke. I am serious!  I would never again tour with large groups going from place to place on a huge bus with so many people. \\n\\nThis tour was truly a delight and we plan to travel with Off the Beaten Path in the hopefully near future.\\nGood site but not clear enough on pricing\\nThis has to be my worst customer experience ever. They have terrible identity security, and their customer service representatives are incompetent. I was on the line for an hour, and after talking to two separate CSR\\'s, with the supervisor Valerie being the most incompetent, they finally put me through to the loss prevention department where I was presented with an answering machine. Keep in mind that the first words out of my mouth when I called them was \"Can I speak to the loss prevention department please\". I strongly recommend no one ever do business with this company.\\nAlways get what I want. Exchanges are easy. I\\'ve messed up a few orders on my end and they did everything possible and got me what I actually wanted!\\nI installed the ignition coil and it did not work\\nVery help full and nice.\\nReceived the correct wheels, best price on the web, fast shipment and the rebate was processed quickly. Worried about the neg reviews but the transaction went smoothly and I am a happy customer .\\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nThe website is very friendly and easy to navigate through. The online convection was incredible because as soon as I click on the bottom I received an email confirming the booking. Let\\'s wait for the trio and see how is the service with the airline etc.\\nI found the price and had the chance to compare with other airlines. I recommend it so far.\\nI ordered a replacement passenger side mirror from PartsGeek.  I had no problem finding it for my car on the site, the checkout process was swiftly completed, and I had the part within a week.  I had no problems (outside of rain!) replacing the mirror.\\nMy mom loves your collage puzzles (less interested in landscapes and scenery).  More 500/550 piece puzzles in this format/style would be welcome.  You have many that we would purchase but 1000 piece versions are too large to work on.\\nArrived on time and good quality will buy again\\nIt was a hassle free and quick way to book a car.\\nTom is very highly versed in the security system\\'s hardware and software systems and their installation.  He does neat work and wants the customer to be satisfied and happy with the end product.  He left us well trained and ready to start using the system to advantage.  He gave us his cell phone number, in case we have any follow-up questions.  Plus he is a really nice guy!\\nI have used Career Builder for several years and it has broadened my job \\nopportunities greatly. Never any trouble navigating or updating my profile.\\nLots of  help from   Sales lady  LINDA❗️❗️❗️\\nWe\\'ve use Budget Dumpster for jobs in Laredo, TX & Austin, TX. The only complaint I have was for the Austin job. They don\\'t rent monthly its based on a set day limit for a pull & swap. Anything beyond that acquires additional fees. Being a construction company having dumpster for month before having to swap it is normal. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther than that the staff was very nice & extremely helpful.\\nGreat service. Received flags quickly with no issues.\\nI don\\'t like to leave negative reviews but I feel it is necessary to share the bad experience I have had from One.com - particularly after attempting a resolution and instead receiving a confrontational exchange from one of the (so-called) managers on the live chat desk. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will try and keep my story brief but basically I set up a website for a friend a while ago for her new company. A little while after setting it up, we both attempted to request that the ownership information was changed into her name and company name - mainly for accounting purposes. However, I kept receiving the bills and was sent a couple of reminders, including interest incurred. Upon attempting to contact One.com by email (you can only do this online, so no telephone option), I did not hear anything back to confirm my previous requests had been received to change ownership. Instead, today I received an email from a debt collection company demanding the account is settled within 7 days. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter speaking to a very helpful person at Intrum Justitia Ireland Ltd. debt collectors, I was advised to speak to One.com to resolve, via their Live Help Desk (as the best option) to try and resolve and to have the collection order rescinded, considering the circumstances. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, after a protracted conversation with one team member, which transpired that One.com only changed the domain name registration, not the webspace registration, I requested the case was reviewed by a manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey in no uncertain terms told me that because they had apparently sent me a \\'handover\\' form, they would not be willing to either resend the form or set up the change of ownership (despite me not receiving such a form) and instead I would have to settle the account with the debt collectors, because otherwise \"they would have to burden any costs of withdrawing\" their claim to the debt collectors. Upon challenging this further, I was met with very curt, confrontational responses from the manager who offered no willingness to help or resolve the matter - instead effectively arguing with me in a live chat exchange - to the extent where they were suggesting by offering me a sent date and time for the link they apparently sent me for the handover form (which I didn\\'t receive), was proof that I had received and read the changeover form:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have given you the date and time. Send it to your mail service provider... And they can check the logs. That will be the proof\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I retorted, if I had received and read the changeover form I would have actioned it, which meant I would not have been having the conversation with him in the first place. So, instead of resending the form, or offering to process the exchange of ownership as previously requested, I was told to settle the account with the debt collectors, including interest incurred, because there was nothing else they could do (or were willing to do, despite having the ability to do so) \\r\\n\\r\\nI am incredulous to say the least. I have never experienced such poor, impersonal and unprofessional service from a service provider. For the record, during the exchange I mentioned to the manager (after giving several opportunities to put things right) that I would be sharing my experience on Trustpilot. He responded by saying that I would be \"defaming their name on unfounded grounds\". Well, I can assure you my experience is very real. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have several companies, 3 of which are already registered with One.com. I will be cancelling all of the subscriptions to their service and would prefer to take my business elsewhere. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not my place to say to avoid One.com but I just hope if you do use them, that you experience much better service than I have.\\nSupport is really bad! Very arrogant staff and talk to you very rudely. Try avoiding them at all cost.\\nI had priced some lettering locally in Canada and was not happy with the price, I found a few on line offers and DIY was the only one who not only replied to my inquiry in a quick manner they helped with the design and once I ordered the lettering it was delivered quickly. The quality is top notch from order to product. Would highly recommend them and definitely use them for all my lettering needs.\\nExcellent selection, price and order shipping and handling.  Only thing I ran into is I opted for expedited shipping and had the glasses sent to my office where I spend most days.  I got an email from a customer service rep asking that I write back and say I agree with their shipping policy before they would send the product because they\\'re \\'shipping to a business\\'.  That delayed things and was a bit confusing, never had that happen and I get stuff sent to the office all the time.  But I agreed and the product showed up as expected.  Had to return it as it was too small (my fault, I ordered the wrong size) and so far the return process has been clearly articulated at every step of the way and very smooth.  So one little glitch but overall I\\'m planning on shopping with them again.\\nThe driver was there as promised snd drove safely in time to JFK.\\nFirst class service!!\\nReservation was quick, easy, and affordable.  Parking was easy to find, van was on time, all went well.\\nService is great. Prices are reasonable. Auctions are fun. Items are almost always described and graded accurately. For some reason, I have gotten several comics from Lone Star where one of the bottom corners of the book is bent. Like they were dropped somewhere along the line either when being put into their inventory or packing to be shipped out.\\nGreat people who have been working there for years. Very helpful and fast service!\\nI waited 4 weeks for the visa to be put in my passport.  I needed it quickly to apply for another visa needed.\\nI did not receive an e-mail until in was sent.\\nI called directly every week. Last week I was told that it would arrive, Friday, September 2, 2016.  I waited at home all day.\\nI called for the fourth time on Monday, September 5, 2016 and the passport had not been cleared by the agent.  A few hours later I received my first e-mail and it was overnighted Fed-Ex. I received it Tuesday, September 6.  A disappointing experience for the price.\\nWould be a 5 PLUS....but it took too much effort to get a receipt.  An invoice.  Strongly recommend them.  Yes, I do, make no mistake.  Everyone can improve on something - nothing is perfect.  But a simple itemized receipt? A quick win as an easy thing to improve.  Please.  You\\'re too good to have something so minor mar your attractiveness as a business entity.    ... I would still do business with them again - and gladly so.\\nHelped me find a good insulation foam contractor, but had to go through some fairly bad ones that are still listed on home advisor.\\nCustomer service completely failed and lack of meaningful options to find out a sale status led to an ordered being cancelled . When a real person was finally reached , this person didn\\'t give two cents about it . Amazon will put you guys under\\nStaying in baymont was a very good experience we got offered trolleys and they served us good breakfast. I recommend this hotel.  The whole staff was very helpful.\\nI wouldnt ever order from this company again. My girlfriend had ordered me a controller for christmas, it had just showed up on her doorstep 2 days ago. Thats over a month from when she ordered it. When we called to figure out what happened they said that it was \"just sitting on a shelf and that it would be shipped within a few days\" thats when we recieved it 2 1/2 weeks later. So we got it and i took it out of the box and was imediatly floored. They screwed up what she ordered the text that she got on the controller was in the wrong color and in the wrong font wich makes the controller as a whole ruined. And the so called \"mods\" that it comes with dont work on battlefield or call of duty which are both advertised on the site. And to top it off there were no instructions on how to use the mods or even find out which ones your using. I am completly disgusted by this company for selling peices of trash for so much money my gf ended up paying around $200 for something that was late, to overpriced and not even what we ordered. I will be writing a bad review everywhere i can on the internet unless this company rights their wrongs.\\nI love the format, and I\\'m definitely learning German through their immersion method.  The pictures can be ambiguous, though, and often require some thinking about what the picture is, rather than what I\\'m meant to understand in another language. If not for the frustration with this ambiguity, I would rate it 5 stars for the actual learning of another language.\\nYou have to check out the place once you buy items you\\'ll buy items for life\\nAvant credit provided my business loan with the easiest execution I have ever experienced.  They fulfilled their commitments without a hitch; that is surprising in today\\'s financial arena.  Thank you for being available to the small business of America!!\\nProduct was installed well but there are limits on where installers can go. For example cannot go in attic to make connections. I had to do this myself. Product operating very well with no drop in service over one year. Contract does not allow for vacation mode if gone for extended period of time. My ISP in another town provides this flexibility with appropriate limits.\\nID Wholesaler has gone out of their way to help us. First Class all the way!\\nBy far my favourite T-shirt shop!\\nI loved my booking experience and hotel stay! Thank you kindly Priceline.\\nGreat service apart from trying to sell you extra imsurance\\nGreat variety, good quality products, fair prices, fast shipping\\nProducts 💯  PERCENT. So far NEVER had issue w/any purchase made. My comment is legitimate.\\nWanted a last minute Christmas gift.   The club I ordered was a direct ship from manufacturer.   I did upgrade the shipping.   Ordered on Saturday, December 19th and club arrived Wednesday, December 23rd.  Thanks Golf HQ and Tour Edge.\\nTheir customer service was very helpful and I got exactly the product I wanted. We will defiantly be ordering from them again!\\nI have placed a gang of orders through ONNIT.com. every order has come on time and in great condition. The only time my order was incorrect, they allowed me to keep the product they sent me by mistake and express shipped the correct product that day. The  phone operator was very helpful and friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nONNIT has great products, decent prices, and is an overall GREAT company. I recommend ONNIT to everyone I know, even if they do not ask!\\nI will recommend this company to anyone who wants to sell books or other media. I had an issue that they quickly handled for me and in a way that went beyond what they had to. Trust this company!\\nI stumbled upon them in a Google search. I had a question about a particular bag. Called them, and my question was quickly answered by a very nice human (didn\\'t have to jump through hoops first via robot). Their inventory is phenomenal. I even received a thank you email after my order, and an explanation that my bags would be shipping get from multiple locations. Shipping was incredibly fast!! Excellent experience all the way around. I found my new source for my bags!\\nGreat experience\\nGreatmats had just what I wanted at a good price delivered promptly...will use again.\\nFast delivery and nice games!\\nI have been using Transfast for quite some time now. I can easily say when you consider exchange rates they tops the list easily. The transfers are mostly completed within 24 hrs. Moreover there was no fee for transaction even though the amount was less than $1000. What else could you ask for. Excellent!\\nfriendly quick arrangement, very clear appointment\\nMy package came super fast and in great condition. I highly recommend checking them out\\nSuper easy to follow and understand!\\nExpedia charged me over $50 for a so-called \"Travel Protection Plan\".  But when I had to cancel my flight due to unforeseen circumstances, I was told that I couldn\\'t get a refund unless there is a death in the family or there\\'s a medical condition for which there has to be a note from a doctor to show that the traveler is unable to travel.  So, prospective travelers, unless you do expect a death in your family or some serious medical conditions during your planned travel, don\\'t spend a penny on that useless \"travel protection plan\", and better yet, don\\'t use Expedia for your travel needs.  Instead, contact the airlines, rental car companies, and hotels directly.  With those merchants, you tend to have greater flexibility.\\nI am always very satisfied with NFM\\'s products and fast delivery.\\nWhole process from start to finish was smooth. Shipment came earlier than expected.\\nI\\'ve tried the major companies and stopped buying from them because their plants have always been a disappointment.  When I made my 1st purchase from you I was amazed at the quality and size of plants that I received.  The plants are always of the best quality!\\nExactly what I was looking for! I have had many jobs call me or email me inviting me to do an interview with them. Thank you so very much.I also like that CareerBuilder shows me who has looked at my resume.\\nI can\\'t honestly reply to this with a better rating because I don\\'t remember which company/position this was applying too.\\n\\nHowever, I do find that using the CareerBuilder site is user friendly.\\nAvailable reps.,fully explained any questions we had. The outcome was quick and more then we expected.\\nThis was nothing more than a regular taxi cab ride. Our driver was on speaker phone the entire car ride (45 mins) to the airport. Not only was his conversation annoying to listen to but it made me feel unsafe that he was not paying attention to the road. He did not once ask us if we were comfortable. I would be hesitant to use his service ever again as a taxi ride is even less expensive!\\nThey made sure the order arrived on time.  Thanks so much\\nI have rewards cards with 2 airlines and could not use my miles for the dates I wanted on either airline. Their total cost to purchase the exact same flight was more than I paid on JustFly. I\\'m a believer.\\nI love the internet for being able to discover stringsbymail I don\\'t have to run around to the 3 badly supplied music stores where i live.\\nThe glasses arrived in a timely fashion via FedEx. The glasses are comfortable, and fit me well. I had the chance to try the frames out at another retail store locally before purchasing these through SmartBuyGlasses. Great pricing compared to retail shops found in Iowa City.\\nWhat attracted me to site ground was their BLAZING a customer service chat support. They answered all my questions in timely manor without asking me to hold which shows me they are very knowledgeable. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlus I was looking for a ssl certificate w/ a mid grade hosting plan and their prices can\\'t be beat if you do you\\'re research on google or what ever search engine.\\nI discovered Justfly about 3 years ago & without a doubt they are the greatest travel business i have ever used ~ anytime i think to explore other travel companies i end up being dis-satisfied & come right back to Justfly !\\nThe customer care team are always helpful & fair &  generous ~ As i travel several times a year between NY & CA & HI, the affordable prices & easy transactions make it all do-able & relaxed ~\\n\\nTHANK YOU Justfly !\\nI bought amother bag from Cafe Press cause the first one was great and so well made. Then when I got a field bag it came dirty with three black spots on it. :( Love them but, this was disappointing.\\ngood experience.\\nVery Happy with the service and availability of so many books and overall use of system\\nBest price found.  Easy to use.  Hotel was exactly as advertised.\\nAlways cheaper prices and good selection of all the books I need\\nthe salesman I talked to was very helpful and knew the product.\\nI bought 2 electronic giftcards recently, during the same purchase.  The delivery email was received that same afternoon, which was GREAT!  I used one of the giftcards immediately for an online order, and it worked fine.  The other one, I printed to take with me to a restaurant that evening.  However, when paying for my dinner, the card didn\\'t work, which was extremely embarrassing!  I will know next time to check the restaurant site to make sure that the card is showing an active balance.  I reported this to Cardpool the next day, and my money was refunded within a few days.\\nPleased with the items I\\'ve bought quick reliable service would definitely recommend.\\nI ordered 3 custom shirts and one wasn\\'t done properly. There was several missing alphabets on the shirt\\nYou increased the calling rate per minute abit too much! Its actually not affordable. Disappointed.\\nI ordered a 40 x 60 print for a room I was preparing for a large gathering.  It arrived on time, but damaged.  iCanvas customer service quickly responded and sent me a replacement.  Unfortunately it did not arrive on time and even more unfortunate was the greater damage on it.  This one had a large gash on the box which pierced through the print!  Needless to say, I was upset.  iCanvas again responded quickly and accommodated my request for a full refund.  So great service, but needs to either improve the quality of their packaging or change their shipping partner.  This frustrating experience was enough to keep me from ordering again. Sorry.\\nRight price, quick shipping at a very reasonable shipping cost.  Not much to not like here.\\nI have ordered with Born Pretty Store several times now and my items always arrive extremely quickly and in good condition. So far I have tried their false lashes, mascara and eyeshadow and the colours appear brilliantly on my skin! I would definitely recommend them, and they are always quick to respond to my email.\\nGreat service. Great prices. fast shipping. I received my daughter and my engraved stethoscopes the next day. This is my 3rd time ordering from them (unfortunately my 1st stethoscope was stolen). I love the color selection. I ordered a copper and black engraved stethoscope for my son a bright yellow engraved stethoscope and orange all fantastic.  I will be ordering from them again soon\\nOrdered shirt, it was mailed fairly quick. It is a present. Looks good\\ntry agoda.com its extremely friendly....\\nI love the Supreme Cream and will definitely recommend it to others.  I discovered it from a sample given to me at a Women\\'s Expo.\\nWent on my phone when I landed at JFK to see if uber picked up. Saw an article that said Dial 7 was cheaper and had online ordering. It took me about 4 seconds to make a reservation, and my car was waiting by the time I got out of row five and out the door with no luggage. Quick, easy, professional, reasonable price.\\nThe initial call with Courtney Buycks was great! She was informative and not pushy. I asked her to follow up and she did days later, again being very informative. She is the sole reason I went with Freedom Debt relief....\\nMy experience while making the reservation was so easy. I\\'m looking forward to my stay.\\nFast shipping!! Very pleased with the tabletop card display rack. Easy to put together.\\nI have been ordering from Bluestone Perrenials for years.  Great plant variety, healthy plants upon delivery, and all around great service!  There was only one time when a plant was delivered in bad condition and it was immediately replaced. The website is easy to use and easy to place orders.  Don\\'t know what kind of plant to get? No problem, just use the plant finder page! LOVE this company!!!! I have ordered from other companies as well, but none compare to Bluestone Perrenials! I also appreciate that you send out notification emails when an order has shipped so I know to watch for it.  Other companies I\\'ve used don\\'t do that and it leaves me guessing when I\\'m going to get a delivery. I will continue to use Bluestone Perrenials for years to come!  Keep up the great work!!!!\\nI bought several products & reviewing each one individually. See below.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo jerk - I ordered one pack of the buffalo jerk to try it out before buying a whole box and this is one the best jerkies I\\'ve had. It\\'s very tender, very tasty and not too sweet. It does have a slight hint of sweetness but not where it takes away from the jerk flavor. I loved it so much I ordered a box. I had been looking for a nice healthy snack & excited I found this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHemp Force Protein Bar - Awesome protein bar! The bar has a really nice texture, very satisfying and I just love the healthy ingredients. It\\'s nice to have tasty healthy option. I don\\'t mind paying a high price for an outstanding product. All the ones I\\'ve had before by other companies have been loaded with sugar. \\r\\n\\r\\nT + Total Strength - I got this product a few weeks ago & am really loving the results. I feel like I can push myself harder than before. I work two job & sometimes feel worn out to workout. I\\'ve used this as a pick me up to get me going. I\\'ve tried other products alike & most times it\\'s loaded with sugar and or made from synthetic ingredients where I breakout. I was initially hesitate about ordering until I found out about their return policy. It gave me the courage to purchase as I\\'ve wasted money on products before because of the break outs & couldn\\'t return them. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnnit 180 -The first day I tried this product I had half of a pack. I felt a slight bit of alertness, focus, and just a general good vibe. The second time, I increased my dose to 3/4 of the pack & those feelings increased. I was glad I didn\\'t have any negative side effects since I\\'ve been so sensitive with other products in past. I would definitely order more. \\r\\n\\r\\nI found out about Onnit through Ameer Rosic\\'s podcast & really glad I found out them. I had slight shipping issue & it was taken care quickly. Overall I\\'ve had a great experience with their products and customer service. Also, I bought the Pull-up bar and Battle Rope. I haven\\'t used it yet & excited to try it out this weekend!\\nSimply perfect and very customer oriented! The VISA Service works excellent!\\nI have been using MyCase Management system for almost 18 months and it is clearly the best decision I have ever made.  Case management, billing and email all tied to individual cases.  Can\\'t beat it.  I am more organized then ever before with less paper.  Fantastic program.  5 stars.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGreat support and easy to learn your way around the program.\\nService was exceptional from the shuttle driver to the front desk. We asked for and got a room with a roll-in shower, but it was so far down the hall, it was a struggle\\n And although the room was clean, it was very poorly lit. Overall, a very good choice for us.\\nPurchase to delivery went smooth\\nCommited delivery, satisfying quality\\nOur tour director, bus driver, along with the many tour guides were amazing.  Got so much knowledge & history combined. Will recommend globus tour to all my friends👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\\nThis is my first order very excited to see the product!!\\nThey blocked my honest review because I was too honest. Please do not buy from controller chaos. Save your money before they scam you too. Contact me if you want the truth\\nThey emailed me last night saying they use OEM controllers for custom controllers which I wasn\\'t told this. They keep changing the story. My exact point. Don\\'t buy from them\\nJust four months in and I was able to settle one debt already.  So far so good.  My Agent Shaun P has been great explaining things and putting my mind at ease.  The couple times I called customer service the CS Team was friendly and helpful.  Great experience so far.\\nGreat service from our CheapOair representative.\\nWe were very happy with the quality of our purchase.  We needed to research a little more to find out what to expect... Anyway, needed to upgrade and are in the process of sending back for this.  The site has been extremely helpful and feel safe dealing with these people.  Something which is important when you are purchasing online.  Looking forward to getting our updated ring!\\nBought it, key arrived five minutes later, key worked\\n“I changed Medi-gap supplement companies easily and am saving $20 each month. Thank\\nMy first order was shipped the same day, with free shipping and a free sample.  When my order arrived I read that there was free return shipping, which I did not need, but it was a nice surprise to know that it is there should I need it in the future.  So then I spent five minutes searching the PureFormulas website for any other benefits I had not seen while making my first order and I was again very pleased to find the multitude of companies they have on their website and the great coupons they offer.  Thank you, I will surely be using your website again, and I have already told my doctor about you too.\\nI can always count on  eEuroparts to give me what I need..\\nIt was an excellent experience shopping with this company. My friend was hurry to get a Hamilton watch in 4 days and he was leaving the country. Bobby helped me to get one and ship it to me by the overnight shipping. We got the watch at the very last minute and the watch is brand new in a great shape. Will definitely recommend this company to my friends.\\nBought a $25 US iTunes card from Denmark. Delivery per e-mail within 10 minutes of ordering.  I will definitely use this service again in the future.\\nThis was by far the best service I have ever used. My order was completed and to me weeks before the estimated delivery date!\\nThe relief of knowing my debt will be paid off sooner and Freedom will control is wonderful\\nI enjoy the site very easy to use.  I constantly use it to add mins over seas.  Very efficient I have always suggested an app.  An app would make the process quicker instead of opening a web page.\\nHorrible customer service. I ordered the wrong thing and was still charged full amount!!! be careful!!!!! They were very rude and I paid for a service I did not receive.\\nGreat bang for your buck. Fast courteous service while checking in. Secure parking lot  and plenty of parking  Plus On-time shuttle\\nfast delivery, good quality, good price!\\nOverall the content covered enough material to get you a passing mark. However the publisher could have done a better and more thorough job of ensuring the words and phrases used matched with the words and phrases that Transport Canada uses. Where it did not match it caused confusion and uncertainty in making the correct multiple choice selection. \\n\\nI passed with a 94% but I used my full time allotment to struggle over some of the confusing questions.\\nI have stayed here twice before for Rock on The Range. The staff was so friendly..my room always clean. I am excited to come back for a third time!\\nThe name plate and plastic stand arrived sooner than expected.

Would probably purchase from again.\\nI really want that Amazon gift card so I can buy more things to put in my storage unit at selfstorage!\\nVery good choices of books available. Books are exactly as described in detail.\\nNakedwines is an amazing company.  They give young winemakers a chance to begin their trade without having to be a part of a huge corporation.  The wine is wonderful.  You NEVER have to become an angel (the name that nakedwines gives those of us who contribute monthly), but if you are an angel, you get a significant discount.  Like I said, I love this company and I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with them.\\nTop quality products. Intuitive interface that’s easy and versatile.\\nfast shipping, everything packaged perfect..can depend on getting those big bags of healthy dog food without having to drive 30 minutes.Just what our Vet. wants our\\r\\ndogs to eat..great prices as well..really glad I happened to find this site.\\nFast parts ... quality parts\\nI\\'m using this product (Tatami Sport Tile 7/8 Inch Black/Gray) as the floor of my home gym. It\\'s sitting on the concrete floor of my garage, but is still sufficient and comfortable for workouts on the floor (sit-ups, yoga, etc). It was very easy to install and is so far easy to clean and maintain. No issues at all with ordering and receiving. Would definitely recommend to others for a similar purpose.\\nFrom the time I started the process until now I am very pleased with my\\r\\nexperience and the storage unit is serving well for its intended purpose.\\nDear Javier,\\n\\nThis was one of the best experiences I have had in dealing with insurance. I have been without health insurance for about a year. While trying to acquire insurance myself I had difficulty navigating the different care options in addition to thinking I would be unable to attain insurance until the open enrollment period in November. Javier you were very professional, and took out the guess work in determining what amount of coverage I needed that was within my budget. \\n\\nI hope all the employees at goHealth are as exemplary and helpful as you Javier. I no longer have to worry about my future healthcare needs thanks to you. Thank you for your time please know that your service is appreciated.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nMatthew Brenner\\nEverything was great as always. Great quality and price. Just extremely slow shipping.\\nI like the extensive variety of plants.  For the price, I find the size of plants small.  Some take off like gang busters while others don\\'t.  In the past year I\\'ve had two plants arrive DOA. Disappointing and I\\'ve cutback my order this year to support local nurseryman.\\nWow no lip service here. I didn\\'t have to wait.  Michael called me back right away. He answered all of my questions and gave me options. I received great service. I was amazed how professional and caring he was. I highly recommend Kingofpi.com. I didn\\'t have to wait for an appointment or drive downtown. You are the bomb.\\nTold me they\\'d pick up a pkg. between 5-7PM window.  Came at 3, banged loudly over and over on door--my kids are home, I wasn\\'t yet--but they are not allowed to answer door.

I will recommend this program to anyone looking for an alternative to the boring classroom drivers-ed setting. Great for long road trips and very easy to use. I actually felt sad once I completed the final lesson and said my farewell to Ace. Well done to the people who created this program.\\nOrdered a three-item living room set including a reclining sofa, reclining loveseat and reclining chair.  All items matched perfectly in new, outstanding condition.  Coleman Furniture kept in contact with us on the status throughout the entire process. Ordered Nov 16th and had the items placed in our house by the delivery company on Dec 18th.  This was good timing knowing the factory had to make the order, ship it to the delivery company and they had to coordinate delivery with us. We\\'ve had items broken or damaged during 11 military moves, but everything was great on this transaction with Coleman Furniture.  So glad we decided to order with them and we saved over $1,150!\\nI have order multiple items from them never had any issues with product or shipping. Simple and easy.\\nThey were always there to answer any questions & help me through the process with my creditors.\\nQuick delivery, exactly as described.

So glad i tried your site.\\nThis is my first time flying and you made it so easy to get my tickets. Thank you so much\\nThe switch to the new app was rough. I wasn\\'t able to log in for a month and a half and had to call to sign up for classes. The staff on site didn\\'t know how to fix it and wouldn\\'t take the obvious course of action to remedy the situation quickly—delete me from the system and re-enter all info from scratch. They were very helpful and seemed to be following orders, so it seemed to be a course of action from management. Eventually, we wiped the record and I was able to use the app properly. At the same time, my wife was still using the old app and hesitant to switch because of my problems. She eventually had to because she was going to lose her points in the old app. Although it makes sense to use this as a method to herd people into using the new app, it is strange that points could not be moved from one app to another.\\nGreat service always get correct order and fast shipping.\\nThe customer service was not good. It needs a better representation.\\nThis is one fraud company... Some body hijacked my account tried to transfer huge amount from my a/c... I m damn sure some body from xoom has done this...

He is a great asset to your company, and I hope you recommend him greatly! He deserves it!!!\\nI ordered a book for school from them.  After almost 2 weeks I finally contacted them via online chat because you cant call them anywhere and was told that they didn\\'t have the book.  Even the day I contacted them their automated system said that they were still preparing the order for shipment.  You better not depend on this book store unless you really don\\'t need the book for a purpose other than pleasure.\\nGreat would recommend to anyone\\nI was simply looking for a textbook and comparing it at several different sites.  Bookbyte was the clear winner, and they had prompt service as well.  I will check their site as a rule from now on.\\nI ordered a set - ballpoint, rollerball and fountain pen two weeks ago and paid for a more expedited shipping timeframe.  After several days I was advised that only the ballpoint would ship as the rest was out of stock - the remainder would be shipped upon receipt when they received their next shipment in seven days.  I called after 8 days and they said their order was delayed another week.  Surprised they didn\\'t email me as soon as they learned they didn\\'t receive their shipment.  Really surprised that no one offered to refund what I\\'d paid for expedited shipping.  At this point all I can do is wait as they already have my money\\nI AM SO HAPPY WITH HDIS. I DO NOT HAVE TO SHOP IN STORES AND I SHOP IN THE PRIVACY OF MY OWN HOME. I LOVE THAT WHEN I CALL THEY ARE SO HELPFUL OVER THE PHONE. THEY HAVE SENT SAMPLES OF PRODUCTS THAT I HAVE ENDED UP BUYING THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE USED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SAMPLES THEY SENT. CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS COMPANY. I HAVE EVEN SHARED MY PRODUCTS WITH A FRIEND AND SHE IS NOW USING HDIS.\\nI just found an old box, printed out the shipping label and sent it all off at the post office.

Normally a great experience though.\\nGood experience overall with my first order, but the competitive price entry (5% off) vs free shipping options (add items that allow a credit for shipping) is a little confusing at first. Comparable prices to competition, but at least for the products I bought, (Optimum Nutrition - various natural protein powders), they seem to have decent prices on all items as opposed to some sites which have 1 or 2 items low priced (loss leaders), and then the rest at high prices. I can\\'t review the order fulfillment and delivery portion of their service, because I just placed the order.\\nThe install men were very nice by there was some sort of technical issues so it took longer than anticipated. Seemed they got a bit frustrated figuring it out and forgot to give me yard signs and window decals. I had a false alarm on one of my windows and have not yet been able to use the sensor on that window, was told a technician needs to come out but I need to be there and I live a thousand miles away so I have to wait until I can get back to the house for them to fix it. Overall I like it so far, hopefully once all the kinks are out it will be fine:)\\nI had a great experience. Ordering was easy, Medisave kept me apprised of the status of my order frequently, it arrived promptly, the order was correct. I would absolutely order from Medisave again.\\nWhen overwhelming debt was weighing like a stressful heavy yoke, and a financial hardship made it impossible to make all my payments, Freedom Debt Relief has given me hope for the future.

Thanks\\nVery nice product and quick service.\\nI found Vidarjewelry on Etsy the first week of March.  I found the perfect engagement ring for my soon to be fiancé and knew that I had to have it.  I contacted Roi and asked if it was possible to have the stone changed in the ring to an Aquamarine and sure enough it was!  I purchased the ring on March 1 and today, March 11, I received it!  The craftsmanship is stunning and the ring is perfect. Roi worked with me every step of the way from offering ways to size her without her knowing, to shipping options to just keeping me posted on the progress.  Roi was incredibly easy to work with and I could not recommend someone more!  His work is one of a kind and absoultey stunning.  On top of that, there was an appraisal of the ring with it and THE BOX HAS AN LED LIGHT IN IT!! As a theatre professional, that little detail makes me smile and laugh and appreciate the obvious pride he takes in his work.  Thank you Roi and the Vidarjewelry team for making this the best experience I\\'ve had buying jewelry and for making an incredible piece for me! \\n\\nLiz\\nQuick access to Groupon, above average tracking of purchases!!!

My only complaint is that the description of the books I ordered are not very accurate.

But other than that I think the website is pretty awesome.\\nI booked the flight from Barcelona to Casablanca and return 2 days ago for Wednesday with airlines Air Arabia.

Besides, when i wanted to select my deperture, it were all cities except Barcelona... I called E-Dreams Customer Service and the man told me \"I see your reservation here so try again\". Maybe he sees it, but Air Arabia Airlines website does not!

Priceline was very easy to deal with I got to name my own price which was a great feature.....and I was done!\\nThe forced survey at th end sucks\\nBooking my vacation was simple, as nd the prices were great. When a problem came up with our flight Vacation Express was there to send all the information  to the resort.\\nI purchased 2 balloon bouquets and a flower bouquet for my mother across country when I found out she was admitted for and emergency surgery. It was the least I could do considering my husband and I are stationed with the military in .CA and my mother was in NC. Balloons were perfect, the flowers appeared nothing like the bouquet I ordered. So of course I contacted the customer service line, after sending pictures of the bouquet my mother received and going back and forth all day, I was finally told it was going to be made right and that my mother would receive a bouquet the following day that appeared more like what I ordered, so the next morning my mother received it and guess what still appeared nothing like what I ordered as far as the colors the bouquet was supposed to be. So I contacted customer service again, sent another picture, mind you up until this point everyone I had spoken to had been so understanding and polite. I went on about my day, while at a class with my son received a voicemail telling me they were more than likely not going to refund my money after the second flower delivery attempt but that I could call back to discuss the situation, so i called to speak with the young lady who had just left me a voicemail. Well the phone was answered but I never got a hi how are you today or anything of that nature but rather over heard the young lady who had just left me a voicemail and a gentleman discussing the emails I had sent and laughing about my request to refund my flower purchase because it was not delivered properly 2 days in a row. They were mocking the situation, I said hello many times this occurred for about 3 to 4 minutes, finally I hung up and called back and asked for a manager or supervisor, turns out the young lady who had left me a voicemail was in fact the person mocking and attempting to make a fool out of me, and the gentleman who was with her I was told was the owner. I was furious at this point, I told the girl how I felt and that what they had done was very unprofessional and disrespectful. We spoke for a good 25 minutes going back and forth and finally made peace with the situation, apologized to each other and she told me to give it 2 to 3 days and that our flower purchase would be refunded. So again I continue on about my day when all of the sudden I get a phone call from a .CA number, thinking it\\'s my son\\'s Dr. I answer, and a lady named Cynthia with the company was on the other end, yelling at me and being incredibly disprespcrful to me about a situation I thought had already been resolved, upon her yelling and rudeness I asked he why she felt the need to call and yell at me when she wasn\\'t even completely sure of the situation at hand which she then responded that I needed help and she hung up on me. I was in awe and shock. How amazing it was that this company is in the business of lifting individuals spirits when their families have loved ones in hospitals, to be treated with such rude disrespectful behavior makes me feel as if they are unworthy of the money their customers pay them to have a job. I did reconnect with the customer service line and speak to the so called owner, he said he was going to use this situation as a teachable moment for his team and I hope that is true because no one should have to go through the same situation as me. Needless to say, I will no longer use this business in the future.\\nAwesome! a bit lengthy but prepares so well in a fun way!\\nVery quick reply. My issue with with shipping cost. $16.95 is pricy for a $29.50 light bulb.\\nLove my lights.\\nI have an Oregon sensor and a new Extech sensor from Instrumart side by side. The temperatures register virtually the same, but the Extech humidity gauge is much more sensitive and registers much higher at all times. In response to my earlier review questioning this disparity, I received a prompt personal call from Instrumart. The representative spent considerable time reviewing my queries and was extremely informative about the possible causes of the disparity. This was one of the most positive customer-relations experience I have had.\\nGreat products and smooth return process for an item that I incorrectly ordered!\\nI would order again if an occasions should arise.  Labels look great.\\nThe ordering and shipping process was great (fast delivery) but the product quality wasn\\'t the greatest. I could not even read part of the design on the onesie.\\nThe best belts ans buckles I ever had. Fast delivery and very good service\\nThis is our third purchase from Great Mats.  If we hadn\\'t have liked the first and second purchases, we\\'d not have gone back for a third.  Great service, quick shipping, GREAT MATS!\\nWe were having trouble keeping charge on the battery for an iPhone4.  They let us know that we needed a new battery. They had to order one and it took 24 hours. We went back the next day, they popped the new battery in and reset some things and off we went. No problems. No waiting. Price was explained at the time the order was placed. No surprises. Great staff, great service. We will go back and would recommend.\\nVery easy to reserve.  Received call from manager within hours and was very friendly.  So far I\\'m very satisfied with everything.\\nThe straight hair wig was nice, the curly wig curls are tight and no amount of combing helped to soften the curls, it was just a tight curl afro, nothing like the photo. The photo shows the curly hair falling nicely on the forehead of the model. Very disappointed. I cannot use. I give 3 stars because of fast delivery.\\nThey had good prize in tournament. Also it friendly to US people.\\nThis is the best store to buy your A/C needs.

I highly recommend Hobbylinc for every model enthusiast.\\nWould like to have sample pricing on PL LED lamp considering future order of 350+ and contractor wholesale pricing on an order of that size.\\n!helo is very nive...\\nUsually they get 5 stars but something was just \"off\" during this trip.  We valet and the car was not ready when we got there even after being called in, it just seemed like no one knew what was going on....\\nGreat part discriptions and navigating the web site was very simple and easy.\\nAnd if you do rent from them, DON\\'T buy their online insurance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese guys don\\'t even have a phone number for customer service.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a very unpleasant experience with them.  The car company from which I was actually renting told me their insurance was a scam, and I could cancel it and buy theirs.  But you must cancel by one minute before the time you are scheduled to pick up the car, and if you do, you have to also give up the car reservation (and, I assume, the rate you got earlier).  And they don\\'t make it easy to cancel the insurance -- their phone number is nowhere on the email they send you confirming the reservation -- the number you see is for the actual rental company, and that company knows and understands nothing about the online insurance.  I suggest dealing directly with the local company.  I ended up double-insured and grumpy, and I will never go through them again.\\nHonest description of item and fast shipping....\\nThank you so much for getting me out of a bind and turning around an order in a few days.  Kelly was so helpful in finding me a great water bottle within my budget and with my logo printed on the bottle.  The team couldn\\'t be nicer, more professional and accommodating.  My new go to vendor for sure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Lisa Cole - Hilton Worldwide\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDM2037028\\nAwesome place, I will definetly buy from here again\\nBooked a ticked, had to cancel, called to Orbitz, and got a full refund with no problem.\\nI love thriftbooks so much. They always deliver my orders really quickly. However, only thing is that they should be careful to mark books with ripped covers and obvious wear and tear as good. I was disappointed when I recieved 2 of my books.\\nI was so pleased with how the Titan Cube came out.  The item shipped quickly and packaging was great.  I contacted customer service several times and got quick responses each time.  Great experience!\\nI have a gut problem after my medicine last month July. So my Boss taking this Total Gut and introduce to me, as my order the product arrive i took one sachet with full meal.
